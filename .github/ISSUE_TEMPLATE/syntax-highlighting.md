Check https://forums.bgforge.net/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=139 to see how and where to make syntax hightlighting suggestions.

If you still want to proceed:
1. Make a screenshot. No need for the whole screen, just the relevant part and minimal context.
2. Explain *what* is wrong with highlighting on the screenshot and *why*.
3. Make your suggestion for improvement:
   * bad suggestion: "I think this and that should be colored *differently*".
   * good suggestion: "I think this and that should be colored *such and such*".
