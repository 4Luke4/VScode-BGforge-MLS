## TODO

A list of ideas in no particular order.

These will likely require AST parsing:

- formatting (complete file, range)
- semantic tokens
- find references
- go to declaration (ssl)

These probably don't need AST:

- fix go to definition for multiline definitions (right now the definition regex is single line)
- signatures for baf
