## Tooltip width

Compare:

![default width](resources/width1.png)
vs
![increased width](resources/width2.png)

VScode doesn't currently support variable width for completion tooltips. If you want it to look like in the second example, you will have to jump through hoops as described [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/14165#issuecomment-457396403). You will have to keep jumping every time VScode is updated. If you'd like to have it without jumping, vote and comment on the linked issue.
