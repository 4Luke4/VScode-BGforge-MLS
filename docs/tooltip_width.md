## Tooltip width

VScode doesn't currently support variable width for completion tooltips. If you want it to look like in the second example, you will have to jump through hoops as described [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/14165#issuecomment-457396403). You will have to keep jumping every time VScode is updated. If you'd like to have it without jumping, vote and comment on the linked issue.
