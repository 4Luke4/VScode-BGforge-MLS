`vscode-monokai.json` is taken from [VScode repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/extensions/theme-monokai/themes/monokai-color-theme.json) and only kept here for easier diffing and upstream update.

Same with `vs-seti-icon-theme.json`, sourced from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/extensions/theme-seti).
