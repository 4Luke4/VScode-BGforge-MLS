tp2-file:
  type: 14 # keyword
  items:
    - name: BACKUP
      doc: The BACKUP declaration tells WeiDU where to put backed-up versions of files that would be overwritten so that they can be uninstalled later. This directory will be created automatically if it is missing.
    - name: AUTHOR
      doc: The AUTHOR directive gives an email address for users to send bugs to if there are problems during the installation. You may use SUPPORT as an alias for AUTHOR. The TP2_AUTHOR variable is set to the "emailAddress" value.

tp2-flag:
  type: 14 #keyword
  items:
    - name: AUTO_TRA
      detail: AUTO_TRA path
      doc: The AUTO_TRA flag is used with the COMPILE TP2 Action. It automatically loads TRA files that match your D files. The TRA file loaded by AUTO_TRA takes precedence over all other TRA files.
    - name: ALLOW_MISSING
      detail: ALLOW_MISSING file list
      doc: Allows you to specify files that can be missing (when you try to copy them or reference them from D files). Empty versions of those files will be created on demand. Try to use ACTION_IF instead of this.
    - name: ASK_EVERY_COMPONENT
      doc: This flag instructs WeiDU to ask about installing every component in this TP2 file individually, rather than asking questions like "Would you like to install them all?"
    - name: ALWAYS
      detail: ALWAYS TP2 Action list END
      doc: This flag specified a TP2 Action that is executed at the beginning of each Component, before the component-specific TP2 Action.
    - name: README
      detail: README file list
      doc: The given file is displayed to the user after choosing the language, but before installing any component. If more than one file name is provided, they are checked for existence in the order they're provided, and the first available one will be opened. If you wish to open multiple readme files, use multiple README statements.

    - name: UNINSTALL_ORDER
      detail: UNINSTALL_ORDER String list
      doc: "Do not use this without a real reason.\nSpecifies the order in which uninstallation operations are handled. The operations are STRSET (uninstall STRING_SET and ALTER_TLK), MOVE (uninstall MOVE), AT (perform AT_UNINSTALL and AT_INTERACTIVE_UNINSTALL) and COPY (uninstall all various file operations).\nIf not specified, the order is MOVE - STRSET - COPY - AT.\nIf this is specified, then ALL operations must be specified (if any isn't, a warning is printed). Please note that this means that your mod might start printing warnings three years down the line if a new uninstall action is coded."

    - name: MODDER
      detail: MODDER String list
      doc: Enable additional debug info. By default, these messages are verbose but do not halt the installation. Some options are configurable, see the MODDER in-depth description.
    - name: VERSION
      detail: VERSION String
      doc: "\"String\" (variables evaluated) will be appended to every component's name in the weidu.log file."
    - name: SCRIPT_STYLE
      detail: SCRIPT_STYLE style
      doc: This flag determines how WeiDU will read in BAF and BCS files and write out BAF and BCS files. Possible options for "style" include BG (the default), IWD1, IWD2, and PST. See the Scripting Styles tutorial.
    - name: NO_IF_EVAL_BUG
      doc: This action solves a long-standing bug with the IF_EVAL action. Since solving it is not directly possible without damaging backwards compatibility, you have to use this action (preferably in an ALWAYS statement) to solve the bug for yourself. IF_EVAL will not work with this action in the TP2 - use PATCH_IF and BUT_ONLY_IF_IT_CHANGES instead.
    - name: QUICK_MENU
      detail: QUICK_MENU lots of parameters
      doc: Used to specify one or more groups of components that can be installed in a single step. See the QUICK_MENU tutorial for syntax, usage instructions, and caveats.
    - name: AUTO_EVAL_STRINGS
      doc: EVALUATE_BUFFER is used whenever variables are evaluated. In particular, you can now "forget" about using it in FUNCTIONs and arrays. Note, TP2 defines multiple instances of EVALUATE_BUFFER, like EVALUATE_BUFFER, but these are not affected by AUTO_EVAL_STRINGS.

tp2-language:
  type: 14 #keyword
  items:
    - name: LANGUAGE
      detail: LANGUAGE languageName languageDirectory defaultLanguageTRA list
      doc: The languageName is the name of the language as it is presented to the user. "American English" and "Italiano" are examples. The languageDirectory is the name of the subdirectory in which you have stored the TRA files for that language. Examples include "american" and "spanish". The variable named LANGUAGE is set to languageDirectory if the user selects this language.. Finally, all of the TRA files in the defaultLanguageTRA list are loaded as soon as the user selects a language.

tp2-component-flag:
  type: 14 # keyword
  items:
    - name: DEPRECATED
      detail: DEPRECATED String
      doc: Mark the given component as deprecated. If it is currently installed, it will be uninstalled and the given String will be displayed. The user will never be asked to install the given component -- it will be silently skipped in all listings. However, it will still take up a "component number".
    - name: REQUIRE_COMPONENT
      detail: REQUIRE_COMPONENT modToUninstall modComponent String
      doc: Make this component so that it can only be installed if another component is installed. If that other component is not installed, the String will be displayed and the user will not get a chance to install this component. This is in some sense the opposite of the UNINSTALL TP2 Action. For example, REQUIRE_COMPONENT "setup-ease.tp2" "0" "You must have infinite stacking installed!" prevents a component from being installed unless the infinite stacking part of the Ease-of-Use mod is installed.
    - name: FORBID_COMPONENT
      detail: FORBID_COMPONENT modToUninstall modComponent String
      doc: Make this component so that it can only be installed if another component is not installed. This does the opposite of REQUIRE_COMPONENT.
    - name: REQUIRE_PREDICATE
      detail: REQUIRE_PREDICATE value String
      doc: This component can only be installed if the value evaluates to true (non-zero).
    - name: SUBCOMPONENT
      detail: SUBCOMPONENT String [ value ]
      doc: At most one component of the given subcomponent group can be installed at any time. All subcomponents of the same group are listed together for the user. See the SUBCOMPONENT tutorial.
    - name: FORCED_SUBCOMPONENT
      detail: FORCED_SUBCOMPONENT String [ value ]
      doc: See the SUBCOMPONENT tutorial.
    - name: GROUP
      detail: GROUP String [ value ]
      doc: Used for grouping components; the user will be asked to display these or not. See the GROUP tutorial.
    - name: INSTALL_BY_DEFAULT
      doc: If WeiDU would ask the user whether to install this component or not, and this component is not already installed, WeiDU will instead install it by default (without asking the user). If there is an error or the component is already installed, WeiDU will ask the user. The --uninstall command-line argument overrides this. See also REQUIRE_COMPONENT and ALWAYS.
    - name: DESIGNATED
      detail: DESIGNATED forcedNumber
      doc: Normally module components are numbered based on their order in the TP2 file (starting from 0). This flag sets the current component number to forcedNumber. The next component (if it lacks a DESIGNATED flag) will be forcedNumber+1. You can easily shoot yourself in the foot by setting forcedNumber too low (e.g., so that multiple components have the same number).
    - name: NO_LOG_RECORD
      doc: Normally all module components are recorded in WeiDU.log and can be uninstalled later. This component flag prevents this component from writing a log record when it is successfully installed. As a result it is “invisible” to WeiDU, can be installed multiple times, and cannot be uninstalled with WeiDU. Do not use this flag without a real reason.
    - name: LABEL
      detail: LABEL String
      doc: Defines the LABEL, or unique textual identifier, of this module. Any component can have zero or more LABELs. Will print a warning if two components in the same tp2 share a LABEL. Do not alter a component's LABEL once you publish that mod.


tp2-action:
  type: 3 # function
  items:
    - name: COPY
      detail: COPY optNoBackup optGlob fromFile toFile ... patch list when list
      doc: You may specify as many fromFile-toFile pairs as you like. Each fromFile is copied to its associated toFile. If there are any WeiDU variables inside explicit %s in toFile or fromFile, they are replaced by their values. All of the patches are applied. If there are any when conditions and any of them are false, the copy does not happen. A typical example is COPY "mymod/sword.itm" "override/m#sword.itm". COPY commands set the user-defined SOURCE_DIRECTORY, SOURCE_FILESPEC, SOURCE_FILE, SOURCE_RES, SOURCE_EXT, DEST_DIRECTORY, DEST_FILESPEC, DEST_FILE,DEST_RES and DEST_EXT variables based on fromFile and toFile as follows. If fromFile is mymod/cre/bigboss.cre, then SOURCE_DIRECTORY is mymod/cre, SOURCE_FILESPEC is mymod/cre/bigboss.cre, SOURCE_FILE is bigboss.cre, SOURCE_RES is bigboss and SOURCE_EXT is cre. The DEST_ variables are similarly based on toFile. In addition, SOURCE_SIZE is set to the size (in bytes) of the source file. This is generally only useful if you have enabled globbing. Any user-defined variables in toFile are replaced with their values. You may also reference these variables in patches.

    - name: COPY_EXISTING
      detail: COPY_EXISTING optNoBackup fromFile toFile ...
      doc: Behaves like COPY except that the fromFiles are drawn from the game BIFFs or override directory. This is useful for making changes to files that other mods may have changed as well.

    - name: COPY_EXISTING_REGEXP
      detail: COPY_EXISTING_REGEXP optNoBackup optGlob fromFileRegexp toDirOrFile ... patch list when list
      doc: 'Behaves like COPY_EXISTING except that fromFileRegexp may contain regular expressions (regexps). Additionally, toDirOrFile may reference matched groups in fromFileRegexp with \1, \2, etc. If toDirOrFile is an existing directory or lacks a file extension, it will be treated as a directory and all matching files in the game BIFFs will be copied there. Otherwise, toDirOrFile will be treated as a file. If GLOB is specified, matching files in override will also be patched and copied. If a file appears in both the BIFFs and the override folder, it will only be copied once. For example, if HARM.ITM is in the BIFFs and HARM2.ITM is in override, this code will copy and patch them both: COPY_EXISTING_REGEXP GLOB ~HARM.*.ITM~ ~override~ SAY // ... whatever'

    - name: COPY_LARGE
      detail: COPY_LARGE optNoBackup optGlob fromFile toFile ...
      doc: Behaves like COPY except that the fromFiles can be of arbitrary size (the limit should be over a Gigabyte), but on the other side of the coin you can't apply patches to the copying. Like COPY, COPY_LARGE sets the variables SOURCE_DIRECTORY, SOURCE_FILESPEC, SOURCE_FILE, SOURCE_RES, SOURCE_EXT, SOURCE_SIZE, DEST_DIRECTORY, DEST_FILESPEC, DEST_FILE, DEST_RES and DEST_EXT.

    - name: COPY_RANDOM
      detail: COPY_RANDOM ( file1 list ) [ ( fileN list ) list ] patch list when list
      doc: This command works like COPY_EXISTING but the destination for any given source file in the file1-list is some other different file in the file1-list. Similarly, the destination for any file in the fileN-list is some other file in the fileN-list. This allows you to randomly shuffle categories of game resources.

    - name: COPY_ALL_GAM_FILES
      detail: COPY_ALL_GAM_FILES patch list when list
      doc: Copies Default.gam from the biff and the ones in the save/ and mpsave/ saved games, applying the list of patches. If there are any when conditions and any of them are false, the copy does not happen. NO BACKUP is applied to files in the save/ and mpsave/ directories. The savegame from the biffs is backed up as usual.

    - name: MOVE
      detail: MOVE optNoBackup fromFile toFile ... ( directory-file-regexp ) toFile ...
      doc: "If optNoBackup is specified, in addition to the usual effects, fromFile may be moved to toFile even if one or both contain spaces in their names. Do not use this feature without a real reason. You may specify as many fromFile--toFile pairs as you like. Each fromFile is moved to its associated toFile.\nIf fromFile is a file, toFile can be a file or a directory; if fromFile is a directory, toFile must be a directory; if fromFile doesn't exist, an error is raised. If toFile already exists, MOVE is equivalent to COPY_LARGE.\nMOVE also supports the directory-file-regexp construct in place of fromFile; in this form, it must be wrapped in parenthesis, toFile must be a directory, and no error is raised if no file is matched. Examples:\nMOVE ~sourceFile~ ~destinationFile~ MOVE ~sourceFile~ ~destinationDirectory~ MOVE ~sourceDirectory~ ~destinationDirectory~ MOVE (~sourceDirectory~ ~^[A-M].*\\.itm$~) ~destinationDirectory\nSafety notes: when uninstalling, MOVE is restored first, then all generic actions are restored, then AT_*_UNINSTALL is handled. As such, do your AT_NOW, then do your COPY, then do your MOVEs (exception: if you MOVE for biffing purposes, it is safe to call MAKE_BIFF after MOVE. Do not use the --make-biff command-line argument)."

    - name: DELETE
      detail: DELETE optNoBackup file ...
      doc: Removes one or more files from the file system. If file is a directory, it will be recursively deleted together with anything it contains. Do not use without a real reason.

    - name: DISABLE_FROM_KEY
      detail: DISABLE_FROM_KEY file ...
      doc: Removes one or more files from the chitin.key, while leaving the containing bif file itself untouched. Do not use without a real reason.

    - name: CREATE
      detail: CREATE type [ VERSION version ] resref [ patch list ]
      doc: Creates a new file of the specified type with the resource reference resref and a correct file extension for the file type. If there are any patches, they are applied to contents of the new file. Any existing file with the same name will be backed up, as normal. The file will be created structurally correct but will contain no non-zero data aside from the structural details. The file version will be native to the current game, or default to "V1.0", but can be overridden with the VERSION option, which takes a string specifying the desired version. CREATE supports the file types ARE, CRE, EFF, ITM, SPL and STO and all their known file versions (aside from EFF V1.0, which is never found as a file).

    - name: COMPILE
      detail: COMPILE [ EVALUATE_BUFFER ] sourceFile list [ patch list ] [ USING traFile list ]
      doc: "This command compiles D and BAF source files. If sourceFile is a directory, all D and BAF files within that directory are processed individually. If there is EVALUATE_BUFFER, all %variables% in the files are substituted with their values. After the special EVALUATE_BUFFER is executed, all other patches are executed.\nFirst, this loads all of the traFiles presented. If any of their paths contain %s, the %s is replaced with the languageDirectory of from the Language the user selected. If you specified AUTO_TRA mymod/%s above, WeiDU will also attempt to load mymod/languageDirectory/sourceFile.tra for every sourceFile in the list. Once all of the TRA files are loaded, the D and BAF files are compiled. Any DLGs or BCSs they create or modify are placed in the override directory."

    - name: CLEAR_MEMORY
      doc: Removes all variables from the memory, then reloads the automatic ones (TP2_AUTHOR, TP2_FILE_NAME, TP2_BASE_NAME, MOD_FOLDER, LANGUAGE, WEIDU_ARCH, WEIDU_OS, COMPONENT_NUMBER, all numeric constants such as NAME1, the soundsets, or SCRIPT_OVERRIDE). INTERACTIVE is automatically set when you call the next component. Do not use this feature without a real reason.

    - name: CLEAR_ARRAYS
      doc: Removes the names and contents of all arrays from the memory (while still keeping their values).
    - name: CLEAR_CODES
      doc: Removes all loaded functions and macros from the memory.
    - name: CLEAR_INLINED
      doc: Removes all inlined files from the memory.
    - name: CLEAR_EVERYTHING
      doc: Runs CLEAR_MEMORY, CLEAR_ARRAY, CLEAR_CODES and CLEAR_INLINED.
    - name: CLEAR_IDS_MAP
      doc: Force WeiDU to remove all loaded IDSes in memory (otherwise, if you compile a script, append to an IDS and compile another script, WeiDU will not handle the new IDS entry).
    - name: ACTION_CLEAR_ARRAY
      detail: ACTION_CLEAR_ARRAY String
      doc: "'Forgets' that the array string exists until its values are recalled. The actual variables' values are kept, the only effect is that PHP_EACH will not consider old values."

    - name: SILENT
      doc: Makes WeiDU skip all messages; it's reenabled once a component is installed (or fails to), or a PRINT, PATCH_PRINT, VERBOSE or PATCH_VERBOSE is found.
    - name: VERBOSE
      doc: Undoes the latest SILENT command.
    - name: MKDIR
      detail: MKDIR dirName list
      doc: Instructs WeiDU to create all of the directories in the list.
    - name: RANDOM_SEED
      detail: RANDOM_SEED someInteger
      doc: Sets the random number generator seed to someInteger. This allows you to get reproducible results when using random functions. If you specify a string that is not a valid integer the system initializes itself (e.g., by using the current time).
    - name: ACTION_READLN
      detail: ACTION_READLN variable
      doc: Waits for the user to provided an enter-terminated string and store it in variable. Said string will be stored and re-used during non-interactive reinstalls. See the READLN tutorial.

    - name: APPEND
      detail: APPEND optNoBackup filename newText when list [ KEEP_CRLF ]
      doc: If there are no when conditions or they are all true, the ASCII text newText is appended to the existing file filename (which is read from the game BIFFs or the override folder). Any variables in newText are replaced by their values. If KEEP_CRLF is not present, double newlines in the file (but not in newText) will be removed; otherwise, they're kept. In any event, if the file ends with CRLF only newText and an ending CRLF will be written; otherwise, if the file does not end with CRLF, it will be written before newText.

    - name: APPEND_OUTER
      detail: APPEND_OUTER optNoBackup filename newText when list [ KEEP_CRLF ]
      doc: If there are no when conditions or they are all true, the ASCII text newText is appended to the existing file filename (which is treated as a path to a file). Any variables in newText are replaced by their values. If KEEP_CRLF is not present, double newlines in the file (but not in newText) will be removed; otherwise, they're kept. In any event, if the file ends with CRLF only newText and an ending CRLF will be written; otherwise, if the file does not end with CRLF, it will be written before newText.

    - name: APPEND_COL
      detail: APPEND_COL optNoBackup filename newText [ prepend ] when list
      doc: If there are no when conditions or they are all true, the string newText is appended column-wise to the existing file filename (which is read from the game BIFFs or the override folder). You must have the same number of whitespace-separated words in newText as there are columns in filename. Prepend empty cells are assumed to be at the beginning of newText. A cell containing exactly $ is printed as empty.

    - name: APPEND_COL_OUTER
      detail: APPEND_COL_OUTER optNoBackup filename newText [ prepend ] when list
      doc: If there are no when conditions or they are all true, the string newText is appended column-wise to the existing file filename (which is treated as a path to a file). You must have the same number of whitespace-separated words in newText as there are columns in filename. Prepend empty cells are assumed to be at the beginning of newText. A cell containing exactly $ is printed as empty.

    - name: EXTEND_TOP
      detail: EXTEND_TOP existingBCS newFile patch list [ USING traName list ]
      doc: Loads existingFile (which may be BAF or BCS), prepends all of newBCS to the top of it, applies all of the patches, and then copies it to the override folder. User variables in the filenames existingFile and newFile are replaced by their values. Use EVALUATE_BUFFER if you want to evaluate variables inside the body of newFile before parsing it.

    - name: EXTEND_BOTTOM
      detail: EXTEND_BOTTOM existingBCS newFile patch list [ USING traName list ]
      doc: As EXTEND_TOP, but the newFile file is put at the bottom of the existingBCS file. User variables in the filenames existingFile and newFile are replaced by their values.

    - name: EXTEND_TOP_REGEXP
      detail: EXTEND_TOP_REGEXP existingBCSregexp newFile patch list [ USING traName list ]
      doc: As EXTEND_TOP, but the newFile file is put at the top of the every BCS file that matches the regexp existingBCSregexp.
    - name: EXTEND_BOTTOM_REGEXP
      detail: EXTEND_BOTTOM_REGEXP existingBCSregexp newFile patch list [ USING traName list ]
      doc: See EXTEND_TOP_REGEXP.

    - name: ACTION_IF
      detail: ACTION_IF value THEN BEGIN TP2 Action list END [ ELSE BEGIN TP2 Action list END ]
      doc: If value evaluates to true (non-zero), the TP2 Actions in the THEN-branch are executed. Otherwise, if an ELSE-branch is present, its commands are executed. Otherwise nothing happens.
    - name: ACTION_MATCH
      detail: ACTION_MATCH value WITH [ guardvalue ... [ WHEN conditionvalue ] BEGIN TP2 Action list END ] ... DEFAULT TP2 Action list END
      doc: The value is case-insensitively matched against the guard values. If value matches one of the guard values, the associated action list is executed. If there is a condition, it additionally needs to evaluate to true for the values to match. If none of the values match, the DEFAULT action list is executed. See the MATCH and TRY tutorial for additional information.

    - name: ACTION_TRY
      detail: ACTION_TRY TP2 Action list WITH [ guardvalue ... [ WHEN conditionvalue ] BEGIN TP2 Action list END ] ... DEFAULT TP2 Action list END
      doc: If evaluating the action list results in an error, the error is matched, as per ACTION_MATCH. N.B. TRY is generally not safe to use because many errors are intended to be fatal and if the mod installation were to proceed anyway, it might do so in an inconsistent state, with resource leaks or with other errors. ACTION_RERAISE mitigates or eliminates these risks, since the unsafe part is allowing the installation to continue and re-raising the error allows it to fail, like intended. See the MATCH and TRY tutorial for additional information.

    - name: ACTION_RERAISE
      doc: When used inside an ACTION_TRY, the matched error is re-raised. See the MATCH and TRY tutorial for additional information.

    - name: AT_EXIT
      detail: AT_EXIT commandToRun [ EXACT ]
      doc: "Whenever this component attempts to be installed, commandToRun is executed. Variables (e.g., %LANGUAGE%) in the string commandToRun are replaced by their values. Note that the command is executed even if the component does not install correctly, so AT_EXIT should probably be the last command in a component.\nIf commandToRun consists of a single TP2 filename, WeiDU will enqueue that TP2 file and run it when the current one is done (asking the user all the standard questions about languages and which components to install).\nIf commandToRun consists of the word VIEW followed by a file, a system-specific viewer will be used to present the file to the user. For example, on Windows systems notepad will be used to view txt files and a web browser will be used to view html files. Note: also NOTEPAD and EXPLORER work like this, but use of those are reserved to differently able modders. Otherwise, commandToRun is executed by the underlying operating system (and is thus system dependant). If you want to do something that WeiDU doesn't handle, like extracting WAVs from an MP3, make a batch file and run it from here. Slashes and backslashes will be converted appropriately for the underlying operating system. If EXACT is specified, / and  will instead be preserved as they are. The most common usage is:\nAT_INTERACTIVE_EXIT ~VIEW mymod\\README.txt~\nThis causes your README file to be displayed using a system appropriate viewer. Here's a more complicated example that pulls up a language-specific README if one is available:\nACTION_IF FILE_EXISTS ~mymod\\README.%LANGUAGE%.txt~ THEN BEGIN AT_INTERACTIVE_EXIT ~VIEW mymod\\README.%LANGUAGE%.txt~ END ELSE BEGIN AT_INTERACTIVE_EXIT ~VIEW mymod\\README.txt~ END"

    - name: AT_INTERACTIVE_EXIT
      detail: AT_INTERACTIVE_EXIT commandToRun [ EXACT ]
      doc: As AT_EXIT, but the command is only executed if the user specifically asked for the component to be installed or upgraded.
    - name: AT_UNINSTALL
      detail: AT_UNINSTALL commandToRun [ EXACT ]
      doc: As AT_EXIT, but when this component is removed, commandToRun is executed.
    - name: AT_INTERACTIVE_UNINSTALL
      detail: AT_INTERACTIVE_UNINSTALL commandToRun [ EXACT ]
      doc: As AT_EXIT, but whenever the user specifically asks for this component to be removed, commandToRun is executed. Only the %LANGUAGE% variable is guaranteed to be replaced, so do not count on any others.
    - name: AT_UNINSTALL_EXIT
      detail: AT_UNINSTALL_EXIT commandToRun [ EXACT ]
      doc: As AT_UNINSTALL, but executed at the end of the WeiDU run (after printing 'SUCCESFULLY INSTALLED xyz').
    - name: AT_INTERACTIVE_UNINSTALL_EXIT
      detail: AT_INTERACTIVE_UNINSTALL_EXIT commandToRun [ EXACT ]
      doc: As AT_UNINSTALL_EXIT, but only whenever the user specifically asks for this component to be removed.
    - name: AT_NOW
      detail: AT_NOW [ variable ] commandToRun [ EXACT ]
      doc: As AT_EXIT, but commandToRun is executed when found, rather than at the end of the installation. Use with oggdec, tisunpack, wav2acm... but not with readmes (you'll create dozens of windows), nor with --make-biff (you'll crash the installation). If the optional variable is provided, a TP2 variable is of that name is assigned the return value of commandToRun.
    - name: AT_INTERACTIVE_NOW
      detail: AT_INTERACTIVE_NOW [ variable ] commandToRun [ EXACT ]
      doc: As AT_NOW, but commandToRun is executed only if the installation is run interactively.

    - name: MAKE_BIFF
      detail: MAKE_BIFF name-of-biff BEGIN directory-file-regexp list END
      doc: Create a biff Data/name-of-biff.bif from the files that can be matched by directory-file-regexp. The chitin.key file is restored as a normal file, and reloaded whenever the component is installed or uninstalled (which means that its contents will be available exactly when the biff exists), while the .bif file itself is deleted or on uninstall as usual.
    - name: LOAD_TRA
      detail: LOAD_TRA traName list
      doc: Loads all traName files (variable substitution is done; the file can be inlined) to be used in the following tp2 actions, as if you had declared them in LANGUAGE.
    - name: WITH_TRA
      detail: WITH_TRA traName list BEGIN TP2 Action list END
      doc: Creates a new TRA scope copied from the surrounding scope, loads all traName files (variable substitution is done; the file can be inlined) and evaluates the TP2 Actions. When WITH_TRA exits, the new TRA scope is discarded, that is, all TRA changes made by WITH_TRA or any of its enclosed actions are forgotten.
    - name: WITH_SCOPE
      detail: WITH_SCOPE BEGIN TP2 Action list END
      doc: Creates a new variable scope copied from the surrounding scope and evaluates the TP2 Actions inside the new scope. When WITH_SCOPE exits, the new scope is discarded, all new variables defined inside the scope and all changes to existing variables are forgotten.
    - name: UNINSTALL
      detail: UNINSTALL modToUninstall modComponent
      doc: If the given component of the given mod is currently installed, uninstall it before proceeding. Do not use this action without a real reason. This should only be used if you release a new version of a component under a new name. For example, many Tactics Mod components replace old Solaufein mod components. In order to prevent such a component from being installed twice, the Tactics version uninstalls the Solaufein version.

    - name: COPY_KIT
      detail: COPY_KIT oldKit newKit ( diffName diffValue list )
      doc: "Copies a copy of the oldKit kit called newKit. This copy is non-player selectable, while all other fields can be edited by setting diffName to the field to be changed and diffValue to the new value.

If the game is of an EE-type, this action patches BGEE.SQL or BGEE.LUA (depending on game version) with the provided quests and journal entries, so they will work with the EE-type journal system.\nFor each of the provided references, which are taken to be journal entries, the first line of text, up to a newline character, is taken to be the title of the journal entry. Titles isolated in this way have any trailing whitespace and full stops trimmed. The title is added as a separate string to the TLK, together with the complete journal entry. The game files patched with the strrefs of the title and journal entry. Each unique title is given a unique quest id and journal entries that share titles end up sharing quest ids.\nIf EXISTING is specified, the strref of the title is matched against the existing title strrefs. If a match is found, the journal entry is added under the quest id of the existing quest. Otherwise it is added as a new quest. Note that TITLE should be given a string reference in this case. ADD_JOURNAL cannot guarantee correct results if EXISTING is used without TITLE or if TITLE is given a string or tra reference instead of a string reference.\nIf MANAGED is specified, all provided journal entries are given a unique, non-zero quest-group number. They share the same quest-group number regardless of whether they share the same title. If EXISTING is also specified, the quest-group numbers for all existing journal entries that match the provided titles are assigned a quest-group number, provided they do not already have one. This option does nothing unless the game version supports quest groups.\nIf TITLE is specified, the provided text is used as the title for all provided journal entries. The titles of each individual journal entry remains unchanged, they are just all listed under the same title. "

        This is a patch function for creature, item, or spell files that will match an existing effect and create a new one based on the matched effect. Numerous variables are available for matching the specified effect and for specifying new values in the new effect based on the matched effect.
        The first batch of variables are meta-variables which will help determine the scope of the function:
        - INT_VAR `check_globals` to whether the function should loop through global effects on items (also known as equipping effects) and spells (default is 1). Creature effects are all global effects, so this variable will always be considered to be one when this function is run on a creature.
        - INT_VAR `check_headers` to whether the function should loop through effects on extended headers on items and spells if set to 1 (default is 1). Creatures have no extended headers, so this variable is ignored when used on creatures.
        - INT_VAR `header` to whether the function should target effects on one specific header, counting the first header as zero. A negative value will match all headers (default is -1). Creatures have no extended headers, so this variable is ignored when used on creatures.
        - INT_VAR `header_type` to whether the function should only clone effects on extended headers of the specified type (1 - melee, 2 - ranged, etc.). Negative values will look at effects on all headers (default is -1). Creatures have no extended headers, so this variable is ignored when used on creatures.
        - INT_VAR `multi_match` to the number of effects to clone in the active stack. If you just want to match the first effect and have the function stop, use 1. Otherwise the function will continue matching until the number of cloned effects matches this value. The function will always make at least one change (e.g. 0 or negative values are treated as 1). (default is 999).
        - INT_VAR `verbose` to whether the function should provide some rudimentary information on how many effects were added (default is 0).
        - INT_VAR `silent` to whether the function should suppress warnings when no effects were added. This option also suppresses the verbose option (default is 0).
        - STR_VAR `insert` to the relative position the cloned effect should be inserted at. A value of `below` puts the new, cloned effect immediately below the matched effect. Values of `first` or `last` will put the new effect at the top or bottom of the effect stack, respectively. All other values will default to `above`, where the effect is added immediately before the matched effect (default is `above`).

        The next batch of variables sets the function boundaries on matching an effect to clone. Any variables not specified will not be used to determine a match. The function will only determine an effect is a match only if ALL of the variables specified are matched.
        - INT_VAR `match_opcode` to the opcode of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_target` to the target of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_power` to the power of effects to be matched (default -1).

        - INT_VAR `match_parameter2` to parameter2 of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_timing` to the timing of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_resist_dispel` to the resist/dispel setting of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_duration` to the duration of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_probability1` to probability1 (the upper bound) of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_probability2` to probability2 (the lower bound) of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_dicenumber` to the number of dice of effects to be matched (default -1). This field is instead used for maximum hit-dice (HD) by some opcodes.
        - INT_VAR `match_dicesize` to the size of dice of effects to be matched (default -1). This field is used instead for minimum hit-dice (HD) by some opcodes.
        - INT_VAR `match_savingthrow` to the saving throw type of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_savebonus` to the saving throw bonus of effects to be matched (default -11). Since saving throws can range into negative values, this variable can match all the way down to -10.
        - INT_VAR `match_special` to the special field of effects to be matched (default -1). The special field is used by some EE effects.
        - STR_VAR `match_resource` to the resource of effects to be matched (default \"SAME\").
        Once a matching effect is found, a new effect is created (STR_VAR `insert` determines its placement) with all of the same specifications as the matched effect. The next series of variables allows the function to change the fields to new values in the newly-created effect. Any variables not set in this batch will simply inherit their values from the matched effect.
        - INT_VAR `opcode` to the value the of the new effect's opcode.

        - INT_VAR `timing` to the new effect's timing mode.
        - INT_VAR `resist_dispel` to the new effect's resist/dispel setting.
        - INT_VAR `duration` to the new effect's duration.
        - INT_VAR `probability1` to the new effect's probability1 (the upper bound).
        - INT_VAR `probability2` to the new effect's probability2 (the lower bound).
        - INT_VAR `dicenumber` to the new effect's number of dice. This field is instead used for maximum hit-dice (HD) by some opcodes.
        - INT_VAR `dicesize` to the new effect's size of dice. This field is also instead for minimum hit-dice (HD) by some opcodes.
        - INT_VAR `savingthrow` to the new effect's saving-throw type.
        - INT_VAR `savebonus` to the new effect's saving-throw bonus/penalty. This variable can take negative values down to -10 while still writing to the corresponding field.
        - INT_VAR `special` to the new effect's special field. The special field is used by many EE effects.

        Checks whether a CRE file is well-formed or not, fixes some common bugs, and reports whether the CRE file is still broken or not. In particular\":\"

        - reports invalidity if it is charbase.cre, shorter than the minimum size, the signature mismatches, or a sub-structure has members and its offset is in the header.
        - if a empty sub-structure's offset is in the header, point them to the end of the header.
        - if the cre is valid, force it to use proper order (known spells, spell memorization info, memorized spells, effects, items, item slot).
        - forces the CRE file to use EFF V2 effects internally (or EFF V1 if on BG1).

        This is a PATCH function.

        - INT_VAR `do_message` to 1 if you want explicit an explicit message regarding the cre invalidity. Defaults to 0.
        - INT_VAR `do_reindex` to 0 if you don't want the creature file to be reindexed. Defaults to 1.
        - INT_VAR `do_eff` to 0 if you don't want EFFv1 <-> EFFv2 conversion to be applied. Defaults to 1.
        - RET `valid` returns 1 if the CRE is well-formed, 0 otherwise.

        Install Ogg--Vorbis compressed audio files in a safe and easy manner. This is an ACTION function.

        This function supports Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux and all IE games, including BG:EE. If the game is not BG:EE, the audio will be decompressed and the resulting .wav files will be `MOVE`d to the override. If the game is BG:EE, the .ogg files are copied into the override and renamed into .wav files. Refer to the `HANDLE_AUDIO` and `HANDLE_TILESETS` tutorial for usage examples and a more practical explanation.

        If the audio files need to be decompressed, this function will use oggdec.exe on Windows, which is by default expected to be found in `audio_path`. The most recent version of oggdec can be downloaded [http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/vorbis/vorbis-tools-win32-bin.7z here] (direct link). On OS X, SoX will be used, which is by default also expected to be found in `audio_path`. SoX compiled for OS X can be downloaded [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/files/sox/14.4.1/sox-14.4.1-macosx.zip/download here]. On GNU/Linux, oggdec will be used, but it is expected to be found on the system path and the user should install it him/herself. If you provide installation instructions for GNU/Linux, just include something to the effect of "install oggdec, which is usually part of the package vorbis-tools".

        If the decompression utility cannot be found, the user is warned that the audio files were not installed.

        - INT_VAR `music` if this variable is not 0 and the game is BG:EE, the audio files are given the extension .acm instead of .wav. This variable has no effect if the game is not BG:EE. By default its value is 0.
        - STR_VAR `audio_path` to the path your .ogg files are stored in. By default this variable is `~%MOD_FOLDER%/audio~`.
        - STR_VAR `oggdec_path` to the path oggdec is located in. By default this variable is `~%audio_path%~`.
        - STR_VAR `sox_path` to the path SoX is located in. By default this variable is `~%audio_path%~`.
        - STR_VAR `output_path` to the path the audio should be installed into. By default this variable is `override`.

        Install TISpack-compressed tilesets in a safe and easy manner. This is an ACTION function.

        This function supports Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux and all IE games that support the `TIS V1` file format. The program tisunpack, part of `TISpack`, is used to decompress the provided .tiz files and the resulting .tis files are placed in the override. Refer to the `HANDLE_AUDIO` and `HANDLE_TILESETS` tutorial for usage examples and a more practical explanation.

        This function expects to find tisunpack for one or more of Windows, OS X or GNU/Linux in a common directory under the subdirectories `win32`, `osx`, and `unix`, respectively. For example, in `mymod/tiz/win32`, `mymod/tiz/osx` and `mymod/tiz/unix`, the common directory is `mymod/tiz` and `mymod/tiz/win32/tisunpack.exe` should be a valid file. For GNU/Linux, this function also supports tisunpack being located on the system path (something the user would take care of). If you choose to leave tisunpack to the user, you should mention this requirement in any installation instructions you provide.

        If tisunpack for the user's platform could not be found, the installation fails.

        - STR_VAR `tiz_path` to the path your .tiz files are stored in. By default this variable is `~%MOD_FOLDER%/tiz~`.
        - STR_VAR `tisunpack_path` to the common directory where the subdirectories `win32`, `osx` and `unix` are located. By default this variable is `~%tiz_path%~`.
        - STR_VAR `output_path` to the path the tilesets should be installed into. By default this variable is `override`.

    - name: HANDLE_CHARSETS
      doc: |
        Runtime-convert `TRA` files into `UTF-8` in a safe and easy manner. This is an ACTION function.

        This function supports Windows, OS X and GNU/Linux. If the game is BG:EE or BG2:EE, `TRA` files are encoded into `UTF-8` so the text can be installed without causing problems. `HANDLE_CHARSETS` needs to be used before any text is installed and is compatible with `AUTO_TRA` and all other methods of loading `TRA` files.

        Conversion is handled by the program `iconv`. The program is available as part of the base system on OS X and GNU/Linux but a Windows version needs to be included in your mod. A Windows version can be downloaded [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libiconv.htm here].

        In order to function, `HANDLE_CHARSETS` needs to know a few things. First, you need to specify where you keep your `TRA` files. You do this with the variable `tra_path`. Second, `HANDLE_CHARSETS` needs to know where the Windows version of `iconv` is located. You do this with the variable `iconv_path`. Third, `HANDLE_CHARSETS` needs to know which character set the `TRA` files are in. Note that they can only be converted into `UTF-8` and cannot already be in `UTF-8`. You provide this information with `charset_table` or tell `HANDLE_CHARSETS` to try to infer this by itself with `infer_charsets`. Lastly, `HANDLE_CHARSETS` needs to know which `TRA` files to convert and whether any of them should be reloaded. You can do this with `noconvert_array`, `convert_array` and `reload_array`.

        Unless `convert_array` is specified, `HANDLE_CHARSETS` will recursively convert all `TRA` files in `tra_path` except those listed in `noconvert_array`. If `convert_array` is specified, only those `TRA` files listed in the array will be converted. `convert_array` may contain references to `TRA` files in subdirectories of `tra_path`.

        - INT_VAR `infer_charsets` to whether `HANDLE_CHARSETS` should try to infer which character set the `TRA` files are encoded in. It uses the contents of the `%language%` variable (''vide infra''). If the contents of the variable can be recognised, `HANDLE_CHARSETS` will use the character set used by the localised version of BG2 for this language. If the contents of the variable cannot be recognised, or if the `TRA` files use a different character set than the expected one, `HANDLE_CHARSETS` will fail. Refer to the compatibility matrix below for additional information. `infer_charsets` overrides `charset_table`. Defaults to 0.
        - STR_VAR `language` to the name of the language directory you wish to convert. The default value of this variable is `\%LANGUAGE\%`, in other words, the directory corresponding to the language the user selected at the start of the installation. You should never need to alter the value of this variable.
        - STR_VAR `default_language` to the name of the directory used by the default language of your mod, if your mod has one. The default language is typically one for which the translation is always complete and up to date and which you use to guard against incomplete translations. `HANDLE_CHARSETS` will convert the `TRA` files of the default language in addition to those of the user-selected language. Should these two languages be the same, the `TRA` files will only be converted once. Additionally, any `TRA` files listed in the `reload_array` (''vide infra'') will be reloaded for the default language before they are reloaded for the user-selected language. The default value of this variable is `~~` (the empty string).
        - STR_VAR `tra_path` to the path where your mod's language directories are located. `%tra_path%/%language%` should be a valid directory containing `TRA` files.
        - STR_VAR `iconv_path` to the path where iconv.exe is located. Defaults to `%tra_path%/iconv`.
        - STR_VAR `charset_table` to the name of an associative array where the keys are the names of your language directories and the corresponding values are the character sets used by the respective language. The keys must be entirely in lowercase. `charset_table` is not used if you also specify `infer_charsets`.
        - STR_VAR `noconvert_array` to the name of an array indexed by monotonically increasing integers starting from 0. The values should be the names of `TRA` files that should not be converted into `UTF-8`. All `TRA` files in the language directory and its subdirectories except the ones listed in `noconvert_array` will be converted. The .tra file extension is optional. This variable should not be provided if you also provide `convert_array`.
        - STR_VAR `convert_array` to the name of an array indexed by monotonically increasing integers starting from 0. The values should be the names of `TRA` files that should be converted into `UTF-8`. Only those `TRA` files in the language directory or its subdirectories which are listed in `convert_array` will be converted. The .tra file extension is optional. If this variable is provided, `noconvert_array` will not be used.
        - STR_VAR `reload_array` to the name of an array indexed by monotonically increasing integers starting from 0. The values should be the names of `TRA` files which should be reloaded after they have been converted. The .tra file extension is optional. You should use this variable for reloading those `TRA` files loaded by `LANGUAGE` which should also be converted.

      detail: FILE_CONTAINS_EVALUATED ( fileName varsRegexp )
      doc: 'First, all WeiDU variables enclosed in %s in varsRegexp and fileName are substituted. The expression is 1 if the resulting regexp occurs in fileName and 0 otherwise. If fileName does not exist or has size 0, the result is 0. The comparison ignores case. See also FILE_CONTAINS. Example: COPY_EXISTING_REGEXP ~.*\.CRE~ ~override~ READ_BYTE 0x273 class READ_ASCII 0x280 deathvar PATCH_IF (class = 14) AND // class 14 = CLERIC_MAGE (NOT FILE_CONTAINS_EVALUATED(~pdialog.2da~ ~%deathvar%~)) THEN BEGIN ADD_CRE_ITEM ~POTN08~ #10 #10 #10 ~IDENTIFIED~ ~INV15~ END BUT_ONLY_IF_IT_CHANGES The example gives ten healing potions to all cleric-mages who cannot join the party. Notably it excludes Aerie since she has the death variable Aerie and pdialog.2da contains AERIE.'
    - name: FILE_EXISTS
      detail: FILE_EXISTS fileName
      doc: Evaluates to 1 if the file exists in the filesystem (or the bif file is referenced inside the chitin.key) and evaluates to 0 otherwise. The results of FILE_EXISTS are undefined if fileName is a directory.

      doc: Evaluates to 1 if the file is a compressed biff. Evaluates to 0 otherwise.FileName must match against the contents of what is stored in chitin.key (similar to how command-line arguments that touch bif files work). For example, data/AREA000A.bif. Notably, SOURCE_BIFF outputs file names compatible with this command.
    - name: FILE_SIZE
      detail: FILE_SIZE fileName fileSize

    - name: EVALUATE_BUFFER
      detail: EVALUATE_BUFFER variable
      doc: 'User variables inside the given string are evaluated one additional time. You may prepend EVALUATE_BUFFER when a value is called for and you would normally use a string. You may also use it for SET and SPRINT statements. Example: SPRINT x ~y~ SET y = 5 SPRINT z EVALUATE_BUFFER ~tricky %%x%%~ SET EVALUATE_BUFFER "%x%" += 77 PATCH_PRINT "y is %y% ; z is %z%" This prints out y is 82 ; z is tricky 5. You may also do hackery like FILE_SIZE "myfile" "%%indirection%%". Be very careful with this feature.'

If the file engine.lua exists, WeiDU will attempt to read the game-specific directory from it. If the engine.lua does not exist or does not contain the necessary information, WeiDU will use default paths. On Windows, the user directory is the user's personal directory, as read from the Windows registry. On macOS, the user directory is \"$HOME/Documents\". On Linux, the user directory is \"$HOME/.local/share\". In both cases, $HOME is the user's home directory, as read from the pwd database. The default game-specific path for BG: EE is \"Baldur's Gate - Enhanced Edition\"; for BGII: EE it is \"Baldur's Gate II - Enhanced Edition\"; for IWD: EE it is \"Icewind Dale - Enhanced Edition\"; and for PST: EE it is \"Planescape Torment - Enhanced Edition\"."
