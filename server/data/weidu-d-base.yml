actions:
  type: 3 # function
  items:
    - name: BEGIN
      detail: BEGIN filename [ nonPausing ] state list
      doc: BEGIN tells WeiDU that you are creating a new DLG file from scratch. Any existing DLG file with the same name will be overwritten. The new DLG file contains exactly the states in the list. If you set nonPausing to a non-zero integer, the game will not "stop time" while the conversation takes place. By default time stops during conversations.
    - name: APPEND
      detail: APPEND [ IF_FILE_EXISTS ] filename state list END
      doc: This tells WeiDU to place the given states at the end of the already-existing dialogue filename.DLG. If there is IF_FILE_EXISTS and the file doesn't exists, this action is skipped.
    - name: APPEND_EARLY
      detail: APPEND_EARLY [ IF_FILE_EXISTS ] filename state list END
      doc: Works like APPEND, but the states are added early on in the compilation timeline (just after BEGIN is processed). Thus they can be the targets for INTERJECT_COPY_TRANS and friends.
    - name: CHAIN
      detail: "CHAIN [ IF [ WEIGHT #weight ] stateTriggerString THEN ] [ IF_FILE_EXISTS ] entryFilename entryLabel chainText list chainEpilogue"
      doc: This instructs WeiDU to make a long conversation in which the PC can say nothing. This is useful when you want the NPCs to talk among themselves for a long time. It and its friends, INTERJECT and INTERJECT_COPY_TRANS can incredible time-savers when you're writing non-trivial dialogue. See the examples for ideas. CHAIN will only append to existing dialogues. You cannot use CHAIN to create a new DLG. If the entryFilename file is missing and there is IF_FILE_EXISTS, the whole CHAIN is not compiled.
    - name: INTERJECT
      detail: INTERJECT entryFilename entryLabel globalVariable chainText list chainEpilogue
      doc: Behaves like CHAIN except that all of the chainText is additionally guarded by the transition predicate Global("globalVariable","GLOBAL",0) and accompanied by the action SetGlobal("globalVariable","GLOBAL",1). If you pick globalVariable to be unique, this will ensure that the chainText is only ever seen once per game. This is useful for making interjections.
    - name: INTERJECT_COPY_TRANS
      detail: INTERJECT_COPY_TRANS [ SAFE ] entryFilename entryLabel globalVariable chainText list
      doc: This behaves just like INTERJECT except that the exitFilename and exitLabel are not present. Instead, whenever the dialogue would pass out of the chainText it follows a copy of the transitions that were at the state with stateLabel originally. This is convenient for making quick interjections from NPCs that do not actually change the true flow of the conversation. See the transition COPY_TRANS and the INTERJECT_COPY_TRANS tutorial for more information about this idea. If SAFE is specified, INTERJECT_COPY_TRANS will not warn about potentially unsafe uses (use this if you know it is safe).
    - name: INTERJECT_COPY_TRANS2
      detail: INTERJECT_COPY_TRANS2 [ SAFE ] entryFilename entryLabel globalVariable chainText list
      doc: This works just like INTERJECT_COPY_TRANS, except that any actions taken in the transitions of the state specified by entryFilename and entryLabel are preserved and kept with the speaker associated with entryFilename (rather than being mistakenly performed by your new speaker). See the INTERJECT_COPY_TRANS2 tutorial.
    - name: INTERJECT_COPY_TRANS3
      detail: INTERJECT_COPY_TRANS3 [ SAFE ] entryFilename entryLabel globalVariable chainText list
      doc: This works just like INTERJECT_COPY_TRANS, except that all states in chainText get a link in the entry state, rather than only the first one. Expecting documentation.
    - name: INTERJECT_COPY_TRANS4
      detail: INTERJECT_COPY_TRANS4 [ SAFE ] entryFilename entryLabel globalVariable chainText list
      doc: This is either INTERJECT_COPY_TRANS3 with INTERJECT_COPY_TRANS2-style action handling, or INTERJECT_COPY_TRANS2 with the extended INTERJECT_COPY_TRANS3 state creation rules, depending at how you look at it.
    - name: EXTEND_TOP
      detail: "EXTEND_TOP filename stateLabel list [ #positionNumber ] transition list END"
      doc: "This instructs WeiDU to add the transitions in list to the top of the transition list for the specified states in filename.DLG (which must already exist).If a positionNumber is given, WeiDU to insert the transitions just between already-existing transitions #positionNumber and #positionNumber+1 in the given states for the given file. The first transition is number 1."
    - name: EXTEND_BOTTOM
      detail: "EXTEND_BOTTOM filename stateNumber list [ #positionNumber ] transition list END"
      doc: Behaves just like EXTEND_TOP but adds the transitions to the bottom of the list instead.
    - name: ADD_STATE_TRIGGER
      detail: "ADD_STATE_TRIGGER filename stateNumber stateTriggerString [ stateNumber list ] \tdActionWhen list"
      doc: This instructs WeiDU to add the stateTriggerString to all of the states with the given stateNumbers in the file filename.DLG (which must already exist). This is handy for adding extra conditions to an existing dialogue state.
    - name: ADD_TRANS_TRIGGER
      detail: ADD_TRANS_TRIGGER filename stateNumber transTriggerString [ moreStateNumbers list ] [ DO transNumber list ] dActionWhen list
      doc: This instructs WeiDU to add the transTriggerString to all of the transitions in all of the states with the given stateNumbers in the file filename.DLG (which must already exist). This is often used in conjunction with EXTEND_BOTTOM to make a new branch in an existing state. Use ADD_TRANS_TRIGGER to add the negation of some predicate to all of the existing transitions, then use EXTEND_BOTTOM to add a transition with that predicate to that state. If a list of transNumbers is specified, only those transitions will have transTriggerString added to them. If such a list is not specified, every transition in every specified state will be modified. Note that the "first" transition is number 0.
    - name: ADD_TRANS_ACTION
      detail: ADD_TRANS_ACTION filename BEGIN stateNumber list END BEGIN transNumber list END transActionString dActionWhen list
      doc: This instructs WeiDU to add the transActionString to all of the actions in all the transitions in all of the states specified by the stateNumber list and the transNumber list. You may use state labels in the stateNumber list. If the transNumber list is empty, the text added to all transitions on all listed states. Note that the BEGIN and END keywords must be present, even if you specify an empty list of transNumbers. The "first" transition is number 0. Any out-of-bounds transNumbers are silently ignored. The transActionString is prepended to any existing action text on a per-transition, per-state basis.
    - name: REPLACE_TRANS_ACTION
      detail: REPLACE_TRANS_ACTION filename BEGIN stateNumber list END BEGIN transNumber list END oldText newText dActionWhen list
      doc: This instructs WeiDU to replace all instances of oldText in newText to all of the actions in all the transitions in all of the states specified by the stateNumber list and the transNumber list. You may use state labels in the stateNumber list. If the transNumber list is empty, the text added to all transitions on all listed states. Note that the BEGIN and END keywords must be present, even if you specify an empty list of transNumbers. The "first" transition is number 0. Any out-of-bounds transNumbers are silently ignored.
    - name: REPLACE_TRANS_TRIGGER
      detail: REPLACE_TRANS_TRIGGER filename BEGIN stateNumber list END BEGIN transNumber list END oldText newText dActionWhen list
      doc: This instructs WeiDU to replace all instances of oldText in newText to all of the triggers in all of the transitions in all of the states specified by the stateNumber list and the transNumber list. You may use state labels in the stateNumber list. If the transNumber list is empty, the text added to all transitions on all listed states. Note that the BEGIN and END keywords must be present, even if you specify an empty list of transNumbers. The "first" transition is number 0. Any out-of-bounds transNumbers are silently ignored.
    - name: ALTER_TRANS
      detail: ALTER_TRANS filename BEGIN stateNumber list END BEGIN transNumber list END BEGIN changeWhat changeInto list END
      doc: Fine altering of a single transition. See the ALTER_TRANS tutorial.
    - name: REPLACE
      detail: REPLACE filename state list END
      doc: This instructs WeiDU to load filename.DLG and replace some of its states with the new ones described in the state list. All of the states should have numeric stateLabels (e.g., "5" or "67"). A new state with label X will replace the old state number X.
    - name: SET_WEIGHT
      detail: "SET_WEIGHT filename stateLabel #stateWeight"
      doc: This instructs WeiDU to destructively change the WEIGHT of the given state in filename.DLG (which must exist). This should only be used to patch or workaround existing dialogues. Never use SET_WEIGHT if you can help it.
    - name: REPLACE_SAY
      detail: REPLACE_SAY filename stateLabel sayText
      doc: This instructs WeiDU to destructively change the sayText of the given state in filename.DLG (which must exist). This should only be used to patch or workaround existing dialogues. Never use REPLACE_SAY if you can help it.
    - name: REPLACE_STATE_TRIGGER
      detail: "REPLACE_STATE_TRIGGER filename stateNumber stateTriggerString [ stateNumber list ] \tdActionWhen list"
      doc: This instructs WeiDU to destructively set the stateTriggerString of all of the states with the given stateNumbers in the file filename.DLG (which must already exist). It should be used with caution.
    - name: REPLACE_TRIGGER_TEXT
      detail: REPLACE_TRIGGER_TEXT filename oldText newText dActionWhen list
      doc: This instructs WeiDU to destructively replace every occurrence of oldText (which may be a regexp) in the stateTriggerStrings and transTriggerStrings of filename.DLG (which must exist). This should only be used to patch or workaround existing dialogues. Never use this if you can help it.
    - name: REPLACE_TRIGGER_TEXT_REGEXP
      detail: REPLACE_TRIGGER_TEXT_REGEXP filenameRegexp oldText newText dActionWhen list
      doc: Just like REPLACE_TRIGGER_TEXT but the filename is a regexp. The .DLG is implied.
    - name: REPLACE_ACTION_TEXT
      detail: REPLACE_ACTION_TEXT filename oldText newText [ moreFilenames ] dActionWhen list
      doc: This instructs WeiDU to destructively replace every occurrence of oldText (which may be a regexp) in the stateActionStrings of filename.DLG (which must exist). This should only be used to patch or workaround existing dialogues. Never use this if you can help it.
    - name: REPLACE_ACTION_TEXT_REGEXP
      detail: REPLACE_ACTION_TEXT_REGEXP filenameRegexp oldText newText [ moreFilenameRegexps ] dActionWhen list
      doc: Just like REPLACE_ACTION_TEXT but the filenames are regexps. The .DLG is implied, do not include it in your regexps.
    - name: REPLACE_ACTION_TEXT_PROCESS
      detail: REPLACE_ACTION_TEXT_PROCESS filename oldText newText [ moreFilenames ] dActionWhen list
      doc: "This instructs WeiDU to destructively replace every occurrence of oldText (which may be a regexp) in the stateActionStrings of filename.DLG (which must exist) with newText. However, newText is first compiled as a BAF action list. In particular, this means that replacing with commands like: ~DisplayString(Myself,@123)~ ... will do what you expect. This should only be used to patch or workaround existing dialogues. Never use this if you can help it."
    - name: R_A_T_P_R
      detail: R_A_T_P_R filenameRegexp oldText newText [ moreFilenameRegexps ] dActionWhen list
      doc: Just like REPLACE_ACTION_TEXT_PROCESS, but the filenames are regexps. The .DLG is implied. R_A_T_P_R is shorthand for REPLACE_ACTION_TEXT_PROCESS_REGEXP (to avoid undue scrollbars in the readme on a 1024x768 monitor).
