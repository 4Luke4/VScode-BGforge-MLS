tp2-file:
  type: 14 # keyword
  items:
    - name: AUTHOR
      doc: |-
        The AUTHOR directive gives an email address for users to send bugs to if there are problems during the installation. You may use SUPPORT as an alias for AUTHOR. The TP2_AUTHOR variable is set to the "emailAddress" value.

    - name: BACKUP
      doc: |-
        The BACKUP declaration tells WeiDU where to put backed-up versions of files that would be overwritten so that they can be uninstalled later. This directory will be created automatically if it is missing.
tp2-flag:
  type: 14 #keyword
  items:
    - name: ALLOW_MISSING
      detail: ALLOW_MISSING file list
      doc: |-
        Allows you to specify files that can be missing (when you try to copy them or reference them from D files). Empty versions of those files will be created on demand. Try to use ACTION_IF instead of this.
    - name: ALWAYS
      detail: ALWAYS TP2 Action list END
      doc: |-
        This flag specified a TP2 Action that is executed at the beginning of each Component, before the component-specific TP2 Action.
    - name: ASK_EVERY_COMPONENT
      doc: |-
        This flag instructs WeiDU to ask about installing every component in this TP2 file individually, rather than asking questions like "Would you like to install them all?"
    - name: AUTO_EVAL_STRINGS
      doc: |-
        EVALUATE_BUFFER is used whenever variables are evaluated. In particular, you can now "forget" about using it in FUNCTIONs and arrays. Note, TP2 defines multiple instances of EVALUATE_BUFFER, like EVALUATE_BUFFER, but these are not affected by AUTO_EVAL_STRINGS.

    - name: AUTO_TRA
      detail: AUTO_TRA path
      doc: |-
        The AUTO_TRA flag is used with the COMPILE TP2 Action. It automatically loads TRA files that match your D files. The TRA file loaded by AUTO_TRA takes precedence over all other TRA files.
    - name: MODDER
      detail: MODDER String list
      doc: |-
        Enable additional debug info. By default, these messages are verbose but do not halt the installation. Some options are configurable, see the MODDER in-depth description.
    - name: NO_IF_EVAL_BUG
      doc: |-
        This action solves a long-standing bug with the IF_EVAL action. Since solving it is not directly possible without damaging backwards compatibility, you have to use this action (preferably in an ALWAYS statement) to solve the bug for yourself. IF_EVAL will not work with this action in the TP2 - use PATCH_IF and BUT_ONLY_IF_IT_CHANGES instead.
    - name: QUICK_MENU
      detail: QUICK_MENU lots of parameters
      doc: |-
        Used to specify one or more groups of components that can be installed in a single step. See the QUICK_MENU tutorial for syntax, usage instructions, and caveats.
    - name: README
      detail: README file list
      doc: |-
        The given file is displayed to the user after choosing the language, but before installing any component. If more than one file name is provided, they are checked for existence in the order they're provided, and the first available one will be opened. If you wish to open multiple readme files, use multiple README statements.

    - name: SCRIPT_STYLE
      detail: SCRIPT_STYLE style
      doc: |-
        This flag determines how WeiDU will read in BAF and BCS files and write out BAF and BCS files. Possible options for "style" include BG (the default), IWD1, IWD2, and PST. See the Scripting Styles tutorial.
    - name: UNINSTALL_ORDER
      detail: UNINSTALL_ORDER String list
      doc: |-
        Do not use this without a real reason.
        Specifies the order in which uninstallation operations are handled. The operations are STRSET (uninstall STRING_SET and ALTER_TLK), MOVE (uninstall MOVE), AT (perform AT_UNINSTALL and AT_INTERACTIVE_UNINSTALL) and COPY (uninstall all various file operations).
        If not specified, the order is MOVE - STRSET - COPY - AT.
        If this is specified, then ALL operations must be specified (if any isn't, a warning is printed). Please note that this means that your mod might start printing warnings three years down the line if a new uninstall action is coded.

    - name: VERSION
      detail: VERSION String
      doc: |-
        "String" (variables evaluated) will be appended to every component's name in the weidu.log file.
tp2-language:
  type: 14 #keyword
  items:
    - name: LANGUAGE
      detail: LANGUAGE languageName languageDirectory defaultLanguageTRA list
      doc: |-
        The languageName is the name of the language as it is presented to the user. "American English" and "Italiano" are examples. The languageDirectory is the name of the subdirectory in which you have stored the TRA files for that language. Examples include "american" and "spanish". The variable named LANGUAGE is set to languageDirectory if the user selects this language.. Finally, all of the TRA files in the defaultLanguageTRA list are loaded as soon as the user selects a language.

tp2-component-flag:
  type: 14 # keyword
  items:
    - name: DEPRECATED
      detail: DEPRECATED String
      doc: |-
        Mark the given component as deprecated. If it is currently installed, it will be uninstalled and the given String will be displayed. The user will never be asked to install the given component -- it will be silently skipped in all listings. However, it will still take up a "component number".
    - name: DESIGNATED
      detail: DESIGNATED forcedNumber
      doc: |-
        Normally module components are numbered based on their order in the TP2 file (starting from 0). This flag sets the current component number to forcedNumber. The next component (if it lacks a DESIGNATED flag) will be forcedNumber+1. You can easily shoot yourself in the foot by setting forcedNumber too low (e.g., so that multiple components have the same number).
    - name: FORBID_COMPONENT
      detail: FORBID_COMPONENT modToUninstall modComponent String
      doc: |-
        Make this component so that it can only be installed if another component is not installed. This does the opposite of REQUIRE_COMPONENT.
    - name: FORCED_SUBCOMPONENT
      detail: FORCED_SUBCOMPONENT String [ value ]
      doc: |-
        See the SUBCOMPONENT tutorial.
    - name: GROUP
      detail: GROUP String [ value ]
      doc: |-
        Used for grouping components; the user will be asked to display these or not. See the GROUP tutorial.
    - name: INSTALL_BY_DEFAULT
      doc: |-
        If WeiDU would ask the user whether to install this component or not, and this component is not already installed, WeiDU will instead install it by default (without asking the user). If there is an error or the component is already installed, WeiDU will ask the user. The --uninstall command-line argument overrides this. See also REQUIRE_COMPONENT and ALWAYS.
    - name: LABEL
      detail: LABEL String
      doc: |-
        Defines the LABEL, or unique textual identifier, of this module. Any component can have zero or more LABELs. Will print a warning if two components in the same tp2 share a LABEL. Do not alter a component's LABEL once you publish that mod.
    - name: METADATA
      detail: METADATA String
      doc: |-
        Associates a string of metadata with this component. WeiDU does not use the metadata for anything, but external programs might. `METADATA` may be used multiple times per component.

    - name: NO_LOG_RECORD
      doc: |-
        Normally all module components are recorded in WeiDU.log and can be uninstalled later. This component flag prevents this component from writing a log record when it is successfully installed. As a result it is “invisible” to WeiDU, can be installed multiple times, and cannot be uninstalled with WeiDU. Do not use this flag without a real reason.
    - name: REQUIRE_COMPONENT
      detail: REQUIRE_COMPONENT modToUninstall modComponent String
      doc: |-
        Make this component so that it can only be installed if another component is installed. If that other component is not installed, the String will be displayed and the user will not get a chance to install this component. This is in some sense the opposite of the UNINSTALL TP2 Action. For example, REQUIRE_COMPONENT "setup-ease.tp2" "0" "You must have infinite stacking installed!" prevents a component from being installed unless the infinite stacking part of the Ease-of-Use mod is installed.
    - name: REQUIRE_PREDICATE
      detail: REQUIRE_PREDICATE value String
      doc: |-
        This component can only be installed if the value evaluates to true (non-zero).
    - name: SUBCOMPONENT
      detail: SUBCOMPONENT String [ value ]
      doc: |-
        At most one component of the given subcomponent group can be installed at any time. All subcomponents of the same group are listed together for the user. See the SUBCOMPONENT tutorial.
tp2-action:
  type: 3 # function
  items:
    - name: ABORT
      detail: ABORT string
      doc: |-
        The string is displayed and installation of the component is undone. No error is implied.
    - name: ACTION_BASH_FOR
      detail: ACTION_BASH_FOR directory-file-regexp BEGIN TP2 Action list END
      doc: |-
        For all files that match directory-file-regexp, sets a bunch of variables and executes the actions for each file found. Assuming the file being copied is somedir/yourfile.cre, the following variables will be set: "%BASH_FOR_DIRECTORY%" = "somedir" "%BASH_FOR_FILESPEC%" = "somedir/yourfile.cre" "%BASH_FOR_FILE%" = "yourfile.cre" "%BASH_FOR_RES%" = "yourfile" "%BASH_FOR_EXT%" = "cre" "%BASH_FOR_SIZE%" = <size of somedir/yourfile.cre>

    - name: ACTION_CLEAR_ARRAY
      detail: ACTION_CLEAR_ARRAY String
      doc: |-
        'Forgets' that the array string exists until its values are recalled. The actual variables' values are kept, the only effect is that PHP_EACH will not consider old values.

    - name: ACTION_DEFINE_ARRAY
      detail: ACTION_DEFINE_ARRAY String1 BEGIN String2 list END
      doc: |-
        Sets the array $string1(0),$string1(1) etc. to the various elements in string2.
    - name: ACTION_DEFINE_ASSOCIATIVE_ARRAY
      detail: ACTION_DEFINE_ASSOCIATIVE_ARRAY String BEGIN key1 [ , key2 ... ] => result1 list END
      doc: |-
        Sets the array $string, indexed by the keys, to the corresponding results. The results can either be Strings or values. Example: ACTION_DEFINE_ASSOCIATIVE_ARRAY mix_with_blue BEGIN red => purple yellow => green END

    - name: ACTION_FOR_EACH
      detail: ACTION_FOR_EACH String1 IN String list BEGIN TP2 Action list END
      doc: |-
        Will set the string1 variable to each value in string list and process each action.
    - name: ACTION_GET_STRREF
      detail: ACTION_GET_STRREF value variable
      doc: |-
        The string reference value is looked up in DIALOG.TLK and the (male) string (without any quotes) is stored in the variable.
    - name: ACTION_GET_STRREF_F
      detail: ACTION_GET_STRREF_F value variable
      doc: |-
        The string reference value is looked up in DIALOGF.TLK and the female string (without any quotes) is stored in the variable. If there is no DIALOGF.TLK, the string from DIALOG.TLK is used instead.
    - name: ACTION_GET_STRREF_FS
      detail: ACTION_GET_STRREF_FS value variable
      doc: |-
        The string reference value is looked up in DIALOGF.TLK and the sound reference associated with the female string is stored in the variable. If there is no DIALOGF.TLK, the sound reference associated with the string from DIALOG.TLK is used instead. If the string has no sound, the empty string is used instead.

    - name: ACTION_GET_STRREF_S
      detail: ACTION_GET_STRREF_S value variable
      doc: |-
        The string reference value is looked up in DIALOG.TLK and the sound reference associated with the (male) string is stored in the variable. If the string has no sound, the empty string is used instead.
    - name: ACTION_IF
      detail: ACTION_IF value THEN BEGIN TP2 Action list END [ ELSE BEGIN TP2 Action list END ]
      doc: |-
        If value evaluates to true (non-zero), the TP2 Actions in the THEN-branch are executed. Otherwise, if an ELSE-branch is present, its commands are executed. Otherwise nothing happens.
    - name: ACTION_INCLUDE
      detail: ACTION_INCLUDE String list
      doc: |-
        A synonym of INCLUDE.
    - name: ACTION_MATCH
      detail: ACTION_MATCH value WITH [ guardvalue ... [ WHEN conditionvalue ] BEGIN TP2 Action list END ] ... DEFAULT TP2 Action list END
      doc: |-
        The value is case-insensitively matched against the guard values. If value matches one of the guard values, the associated action list is executed. If there is a condition, it additionally needs to evaluate to true for the values to match. If none of the values match, the DEFAULT action list is executed. See the MATCH and TRY tutorial for additional information.

    - name: ACTION_PHP_EACH
      detail: ACTION_PHP_EACH String1 AS String2 => String3 list BEGIN TP2 Action list END
      doc: |-
        For every value of the string1 array that has been created or read, sets string2_0 to the first array parameter, string2_1 to the second array parameter, etc. and string3 to the result of the array. string2 will also contain the first array parameter (as a synonym of string2_0). then executes the actions listed. More exhaustive documentation will be provided by SConrad.
    - name: ACTION_READLN
      detail: ACTION_READLN variable
      doc: |-
        Waits for the user to provided an enter-terminated string and store it in variable. Said string will be stored and re-used during non-interactive reinstalls. See the READLN tutorial.

    - name: ACTION_REINCLUDE
      detail: ACTION_REINCLUDE String list
      doc: |-
        A synonym of REINCLUDE.

    - name: ACTION_RERAISE
      doc: |-
        When used inside an ACTION_TRY, the matched error is re-raised. See the MATCH and TRY tutorial for additional information.

    - name: ACTION_SORT_ARRAY_INDICES
      detail: ACTION_SORT_ARRAY_INDICES String ArrayIndicesSortType
      doc: |-
        Sorts the indices of the array given by String according to the order ArrayIndicesSortType. String is evaluated for variables and you can use the array construct.
    - name: ACTION_TIME
      detail: ACTION_TIME String BEGIN TP2 Action list END
      doc: |-
        Measure the time taken to execute the TP2 Actions and report it under the label String together with the other time measurements at the end of the mod's debug file.

    - name: ACTION_TO_LOWER
      detail: ACTION_TO_LOWER variable
      doc: |-
        Turns to lower-case the contents of %variable% and store the results in variable.
    - name: ACTION_TO_UPPER
      detail: ACTION_TO_UPPER variable
      doc: |-
        Turns to upper-case the contents of %variable% and store the results in variable.
    - name: ACTION_TRY
      detail: ACTION_TRY TP2 Action list WITH [ guardvalue ... [ WHEN conditionvalue ] BEGIN TP2 Action list END ] ... DEFAULT TP2 Action list END
      doc: |-
        If evaluating the action list results in an error, the error is matched, as per ACTION_MATCH. N.B. TRY is generally not safe to use because many errors are intended to be fatal and if the mod installation were to proceed anyway, it might do so in an inconsistent state, with resource leaks or with other errors. ACTION_RERAISE mitigates or eliminates these risks, since the unsafe part is allowing the installation to continue and re-raising the error allows it to fail, like intended. See the MATCH and TRY tutorial for additional information.

    - name: ADD_AREA_TYPE
      detail: ADD_AREA_TYPE areaTypeName
      doc: |-
        Adds a new (guaranteed-unique) area type to areatype.ids, and sets the areaTypeName variable to the index of the bit the type is associated with: the type can be set with WRITE_SHORT 0x48 THIS | (1 << areaTypeName). If areatype.ids already contains areaTypeName, the variable is set to the type's current identifier and no other operation is performed.
        Also note that only 8 area types can be added to an unmodded installation of BG2; as such, don't add a new area type type unless you really need it (most likely, another modder is already using a type with a similar name, and you can share the type between your mods without issue).

    - name: ADD_JOURNAL
      detail: ADD_JOURNAL [ EXISTING ] [ MANAGED ] [ TITLE ( text ) ] reference list [ USING traFile list ]
      doc: |-
        If the game is not of an EE-type, this action does nothing. If the game is of an EE-type, this action patches BGEE.SQL or BGEE.LUA (depending on game version) with the provided quests and journal entries, so they will work with the EE-type journal system.
        For each of the provided references, which are taken to be journal entries, the first line of text, up to a newline character, is taken to be the title of the journal entry. Titles isolated in this way have any trailing whitespace and full stops trimmed. The title is added as a separate string to the TLK, together with the complete journal entry. The game files patched with the strrefs of the title and journal entry. Each unique title is given a unique quest id and journal entries that share titles end up sharing quest ids.
        If EXISTING is specified, the strref of the title is matched against the existing title strrefs. If a match is found, the journal entry is added under the quest id of the existing quest. Otherwise it is added as a new quest. Note that TITLE should be given a string reference in this case. ADD_JOURNAL cannot guarantee correct results if EXISTING is used without TITLE or if TITLE is given a string or tra reference instead of a string reference.
        If MANAGED is specified, all provided journal entries are given a unique, non-zero quest-group number. They share the same quest-group number regardless of whether they share the same title. If EXISTING is also specified, the quest-group numbers for all existing journal entries that match the provided titles are assigned a quest-group number, provided they do not already have one. This option does nothing unless the game version supports quest groups.
        If TITLE is specified, the provided text is used as the title for all provided journal entries. The titles of each individual journal entry remains unchanged, they are just all listed under the same title.
    - name: ADD_KIT
      detail: ADD_KIT internalKitName String1 String2 String3 String4 String6 String7 String8 String9 String10 String11 String12 String13 SAY text1 SAY text2 SAY text3
      doc: |-
        This command allows you to add new kits to the BGII. See the example file mymod.tp2 or the tutorial at http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=584 for information on how to do this. ADD_KIT sets the variable %internalKitName% to the number your kit occupies in kitlist.2da. This value is exactly 0x4000 less than the number your kit is assigned in kit.ids. Also observe that the kit DWORD in the CRE file format uses a reversed WORD order, unlike all other fields in the CRE file format.

    - name: ADD_MUSIC
      detail: ADD_MUSIC internalMusicName newMUSFile
      doc: |-
        newMUSFile is copied to the music directory and added to songlist.2da under the name internalMusicName. The variable %internalMusicName% is set to the number of this new entry in songlist.2da. If newMUSFile already exists, the variable %internalMusicName% is set to the existing entry in songlist.2da and all other operations are skipped. Variables are evaluated. Some versions of the Infinity Engine cannot handle more than 100 entries in songlist.2da. ADD_MUSIC will fail under those circumstances unless the appropriate versions of ToB Hacks or ToBEx are installed or the game is GemRB or BGEE.

    - name: ADD_PROJECTILE
      detail: ADD_PROJECTILE modpath/PROName.PRO
      doc: |-
        Appends an entry for PROName to PROJECTL.IDS and assigns it the next available ProRef number. Then copies the file modpath/PROName.PRO to the override folder. The new ProRef number can be accessed through the variable %PROName% and used to updated the Projectile type field of an ITM or SPL file's Item Ability or Spell Ability sub-structures.

    - name: ADD_SPELL
      detail: ADD_SPELL newSPLfile type level idsName patch list [ IF_EXISTING patch list END ] [ ON_DISABLE patch list END ]
      doc: |-
        Adds newSPLfile as a spell of type and level into the game (IE, SPPR102 or whatnot), in the first empty slot possible, appends the idsName to spell.ids, and sets %idsName% to the 4-digit code associated with idsName in Spell.ids. While you copy newSPLfile to the override, you also apply the patches listed.
        If Spell.ids already contains a spell named idsName, of the same type and level than the one you're adding, then that spell is overwritten (rather than adding a duplicate version). If you have the IF_EXISTING section, its patches are applied to the current version instead.

        If Spell.ids already contains a spell named idsName, but of of different type and/or level than the one you're adding, then the current reference is removed from spell.ids, and then the action proceeds as usual. In this case, if there is the ON_DISABLE section, the patches declared there will be applied to the older spell.

    - name: AT_EXIT
      detail: AT_EXIT commandToRun [ EXACT ]
      doc: |-
        Whenever this component attempts to be installed, commandToRun is executed. Variables (e.g., %LANGUAGE%) in the string commandToRun are replaced by their values. Note that the command is executed even if the component does not install correctly, so AT_EXIT should probably be the last command in a component.
        If commandToRun consists of a single TP2 filename, WeiDU will enqueue that TP2 file and run it when the current one is done (asking the user all the standard questions about languages and which components to install).
        If commandToRun consists of the word VIEW followed by a file, a system-specific viewer will be used to present the file to the user. For example, on Windows systems notepad will be used to view txt files and a web browser will be used to view html files. Note: also NOTEPAD and EXPLORER work like this, but use of those are reserved to differently able modders. Otherwise, commandToRun is executed by the underlying operating system (and is thus system dependant). If you want to do something that WeiDU doesn't handle, like extracting WAVs from an MP3, make a batch file and run it from here. Slashes and backslashes will be converted appropriately for the underlying operating system. If EXACT is specified, / and  will instead be preserved as they are. The most common usage is:
        AT_INTERACTIVE_EXIT ~VIEW mymod\README.txt~
        This causes your README file to be displayed using a system appropriate viewer. Here's a more complicated example that pulls up a language-specific README if one is available:
        ACTION_IF FILE_EXISTS ~mymod\README.%LANGUAGE%.txt~ THEN BEGIN AT_INTERACTIVE_EXIT ~VIEW mymod\README.%LANGUAGE%.txt~ END ELSE BEGIN AT_INTERACTIVE_EXIT ~VIEW mymod\README.txt~ END

INTERACTIVE is automatically set when you call the next component. Do not use this feature without a real reason.

    - name: COMPILE
      detail: COMPILE [ EVALUATE_BUFFER ] sourceFile list [ patch list ] [ USING traFile list ]
      doc: |-
        This command compiles D and BAF source files. If sourceFile is a directory, all D and BAF files within that directory are processed individually. If there is EVALUATE_BUFFER, all %variables% in the files are substituted with their values. After the special EVALUATE_BUFFER is executed, all other patches are executed.
        First, this loads all of the traFiles presented. If any of their paths contain %s, the %s is replaced with the languageDirectory of from the Language the user selected. If you specified AUTO_TRA mymod/%s above, WeiDU will also attempt to load mymod/languageDirectory/sourceFile.tra for every sourceFile in the list. Once all of the TRA files are loaded, the D and BAF files are compiled. Any DLGs or BCSs they create or modify are placed in the override directory.

    - name: COPY
      detail: COPY optNoBackup optGlob fromFile toFile ... patch list when list
      doc: |-
        You may specify as many fromFile-toFile pairs as you like. Each fromFile is copied to its associated toFile. If there are any WeiDU variables inside explicit %s in toFile or fromFile, they are replaced by their values. All of the patches are applied. If there are any when conditions and any of them are false, the copy does not happen. A typical example is COPY "mymod/sword.itm" "override/m#sword.itm". COPY commands set the user-defined SOURCE_DIRECTORY, SOURCE_FILESPEC, SOURCE_FILE, SOURCE_RES, SOURCE_EXT, DEST_DIRECTORY, DEST_FILESPEC, DEST_FILE,DEST_RES and DEST_EXT variables based on fromFile and toFile as follows. If fromFile is mymod/cre/bigboss.cre, then SOURCE_DIRECTORY is mymod/cre, SOURCE_FILESPEC is mymod/cre/bigboss.cre, SOURCE_FILE is bigboss.cre, SOURCE_RES is bigboss and SOURCE_EXT is cre. The DEST_ variables are similarly based on toFile. In addition, SOURCE_SIZE is set to the size (in bytes) of the source file. This is generally only useful if you have enabled globbing. Any user-defined variables in toFile are replaced with their values. You may also reference these variables in patches.

    - name: COPY_ALL_GAM_FILES

      doc: |-
        Copies Default.gam from the biff and the ones in the save/ and mpsave/ saved games, applying the list of patches. If there are any when conditions and any of them are false, the copy does not happen. NO BACKUP is applied to files in the save/ and mpsave/ directories. The savegame from the biffs is backed up as usual.

    - name: COPY_EXISTING
      detail: COPY_EXISTING optNoBackup fromFile toFile ...
      doc: |-
        Behaves like COPY except that the fromFiles are drawn from the game BIFFs or override directory. This is useful for making changes to files that other mods may have changed as well.

    - name: COPY_EXISTING_REGEXP
      detail: COPY_EXISTING_REGEXP optNoBackup optGlob fromFileRegexp toDirOrFile ... patch list when list
      doc: |-
        Behaves like COPY_EXISTING except that fromFileRegexp may contain regular expressions (regexps). Additionally, toDirOrFile may reference matched groups in fromFileRegexp with \1, \2, etc. If toDirOrFile is an existing directory or lacks a file extension, it will be treated as a directory and all matching files in the game BIFFs will be copied there. Otherwise, toDirOrFile will be treated as a file. If GLOB is specified, matching files in override will also be patched and copied. If a file appears in both the BIFFs and the override folder, it will only be copied once. For example, if HARM.ITM is in the BIFFs and HARM2.ITM is in override, this code will copy and patch them both: COPY_EXISTING_REGEXP GLOB ~HARM.*.ITM~ ~override~ SAY // ... whatever

    - name: COPY_KIT

        Copies a copy of the oldKit kit called newKit. This copy is non-player selectable, while all other fields can be edited by setting diffName to the field to be changed and diffValue to the new value. Valid values for diffName are: clasweap, weapprof, abclasrq, abclsmod, abdcdsrq, abdcscrq, dualclas, alignmnt, clab, lower, mixed, help, luabbr, 25stweap, unusabilities. Currently, lower, mixed and help can only be numbers referring to a TLK string. Unusabilities requires to be both kit and class unusables, there isn't a way to BAND or BOR them.

    - name: COPY_LARGE
      detail: COPY_LARGE optNoBackup optGlob fromFile toFile ...
      doc: |-
        Behaves like COPY except that the fromFiles can be of arbitrary size (the limit should be over a Gigabyte), but on the other side of the coin you can't apply patches to the copying. Like COPY, COPY_LARGE sets the variables SOURCE_DIRECTORY, SOURCE_FILESPEC, SOURCE_FILE, SOURCE_RES, SOURCE_EXT, SOURCE_SIZE, DEST_DIRECTORY, DEST_FILESPEC, DEST_FILE, DEST_RES and DEST_EXT.

    - name: COPY_RANDOM
      detail: COPY_RANDOM ( file1 list ) [ ( fileN list ) list ] patch list when list
      doc: |-
        This command works like COPY_EXISTING but the destination for any given source file in the file1-list is some other different file in the file1-list. Similarly, the destination for any file in the fileN-list is some other file in the fileN-list. This allows you to randomly shuffle categories of game resources.

    - name: CREATE
      detail: CREATE type [ VERSION version ] resref [ patch list ]
      doc: |-
        Creates a new file of the specified type with the resource reference resref and a correct file extension for the file type. If there are any patches, they are applied to contents of the new file. Any existing file with the same name will be backed up, as normal. The file will be created structurally correct but will contain no non-zero data aside from the structural details. The file version will be native to the current game, or default to "V1.0", but can be overridden with the VERSION option, which takes a string specifying the desired version. CREATE supports the file types ARE, CRE, EFF, ITM, SPL and STO and all their known file versions (aside from EFF V1.0, which is never found as a file).

    - name: DECOMPRESS_BIFF
      detail: DECOMPRESS_BIFF file ...
      doc: |-
        Decompresses one or more biff files from either "BIF V1.0" or "BIFCV1.0" into "BIFFV1 ". The biff file is looked for in /data and the CD paths specified in baldur.ini. You should consequently not specify the biff path, merely the name. All matching biff files are decompressed, even ones that are duplicated between CD paths. The biff file is backed up to another file in the same directory before it is decompressed. Since multiple games can share the same biffs, this action is not uninstalled together with the mod. WeiDU will raise a Failure exception if the biff is not found in any of the paths.
        Decompressing a biff file can be helpful in preventing crashes related to area files, commonly WAV ambient sounds or TIS files. Do not use this action without a real reason.

These files have by convenience tph as an extension, due to no reason other than randomness (you can use .tp1 or .xyzsucks if you're so oriented). Please note that, to speed up inclusions, tph files are stored in memory, rather than re-read each time from the hard-disk. If you need automorphing code (IE, you want to edit your tph file), you can use REINCLUDE instead.

      detail: MOVE optNoBackup fromFile toFile ... ( directory-file-regexp ) toFile ...
      doc: |-
        If optNoBackup is specified, in addition to the usual effects, fromFile may be moved to toFile even if one or both contain spaces in their names. Do not use this feature without a real reason. You may specify as many fromFile--toFile pairs as you like. Each fromFile is moved to its associated toFile.
        If fromFile is a file, toFile can be a file or a directory; if fromFile is a directory, toFile must be a directory; if fromFile doesn't exist, an error is raised. If toFile already exists, MOVE is equivalent to COPY_LARGE.
        MOVE also supports the directory-file-regexp construct in place of fromFile; in this form, it must be wrapped in parenthesis, toFile must be a directory, and no error is raised if no file is matched. Examples:
        MOVE ~sourceFile~ ~destinationFile~ MOVE ~sourceFile~ ~destinationDirectory~ MOVE ~sourceDirectory~ ~destinationDirectory~ MOVE (~sourceDirectory~ ~^[A-M].*\.itm$~) ~destinationDirectory
        Safety notes: when uninstalling, MOVE is restored first, then all generic actions are restored, then AT_*_UNINSTALL is handled. As such, do your AT_NOW, then do your COPY, then do your MOVEs (exception: if you MOVE for biffing purposes, it is safe to call MAKE_BIFF after MOVE. Do not use the --make-biff command-line argument).

On IWD2, there are the additional slots shield1, shield2, shield3, shield4, inv17, inv18, inv19, inv20, inv21, inv22, inv23 and inv24. ADD_CRE_ITEM will add the item to the first empty slot in the list. If no slot is empty, the item will be placed in the first slot in the list and the item that previously occupied the slot will be moved to the general inventory. If the general inventory is full, the moved item will be discarded. Additionally, slot may contain one or more entries chosen from inv, qitem, quiver, weapon, ring. These entries unfold to the full range of corresponding slots. For example, qitem unfolds to qitem1, qitem2 and qitem3. On PST, you may additionally use tattoo and earring. On IWD2, you may additionally use shield. The optional argument EQUIP only applies to the weapon slots only and will make the creature have the weapon selected. The optional argument TWOHANDED also only applies to weapon slots and will cause items in the shield slot to be unequipped. The optional argument NOMOVE will cause the new item to be added to the specified slot(s) only if there is an empty slot, otherwise the new item is placed in the inventory.

      detail: ADD_STORE_ITEM [ + ] itemName [ position ] charge1 charge2 charge3 flags stack [ unlimited ]
      doc: |-
        Add the item itemName to the current STO file. An optional + signifies that the new instance of the item should overwrite any existing instance of the same item. The item's number of charges are given by the respective charge argument, which must take the form of #integer or ( value ). The optional position argument must be one of AFTER String, BEFORE String, LAST, FIRST or AT value. AFTER will place the new item behind the item given by String. BEFORE will place the item before the item provided by String. LAST will place the new item after all existing items. FIRST will place the new item as the first item in the store. AT will place the new item at the position given by value, with the first item having position 0. If no position argument is given, ADD_STORE_ITEM defaults to FIRST. The argument flags must be a string consisting of one of none, identified, unstealable, stolen, identified&stolen or identified&unstealable. The argument stack sets the number of item the store carries in the stack and must take the form of #integer or ( value ). The optional argument unlimited should be one of the strings limited or unlimited and controls whether the store should carry an inexhaustible stack of the new item, or not. limited is the default behaviour. See the ADD_STORE_ITEM tutorial for more information.

      doc: |-
        This is a patch function for creature, item, or spell files that will match an existing effect and alter it based on the defined variables. Numerous variables are available for matching the specified effect and for specifying new values.
         The first batch of variables are meta-variables which will help determine the scope of the function":"
         - INT_VAR `check_globals` to whether the function should loop through global effects on items (also known as equipping effects) and spells (default is 1). Creature effects are all global effects, so this variable will always be considered to be one when this function is run on a creature.
         - INT_VAR `check_headers` to whether the function should loop through effects on extended headers on items and spells (default is 1). Creatures have no extended headers, so this variable is ignored when used on creatures.
         - INT_VAR `header` to whether the function should target effects on one specific header, counting the first header as zero. A negative value will match all headers (default is -1). Creatures have no extended headers, so this variable is ignored when used on creatures.
         - INT_VAR `header_type` to whether the function should only alter effects on extended headers of the specified type (1 - melee, 2 - ranged, etc.). Negative values will look at effects on all headers (default is -1). Creatures have no extended headers, so this variable is ignored when used on creatures.
         - INT_VAR `multi_match` to the number of effects to alter in the active stack. If you just want to match the first effect and have the function stop, use 1. Otherwise the function will continue matching until the number of altered effects matches this value. The function will always make at least one change (e.g. 0 or negative values are treated as 1). (default is 999).
         - INT_VAR `verbose` to whether the function should provide some rudimentary information on how many effects were added (default is 0).
         - INT_VAR `silent` to whether the function should suppress warnings when no effects were altered. This option also suppresses the verbose option (default is 0).
         The next batch of variables sets the function boundaries on matching an effect to alter. Any variables not specified will not be used to determine a match. The function will only determine an effect is a match only if ALL of the variables specified are matched.
         - INT_VAR `match_opcode` to the opcode of effects to be matched (default is -1).
         - INT_VAR `match_target` to the target of effects to be matched (default is -1).
         - INT_VAR `match_power` to the power of effects to be matched (default is -1).
         - INT_VAR `match_parameter1` to parameter1 of effects to be matched (default is -1).
         - INT_VAR `match_parameter2` to parameter2 of effects to be matched (default is -1).
         - INT_VAR `match_timing` to the timing of effects to be matched (default is -1).
         - INT_VAR `match_resist_dispel` to the resist/dispel setting of effects to be matched (default is -1).
         - INT_VAR `match_duration` to the duration of effects to be matched (default is -1).
         - INT_VAR `match_probability1` to probability1 (the upper bound) of effects to be matched (default is -1).
         - INT_VAR `match_probability2` to probability2 (the lower bound) of effects to be matched (default is -1).
         - INT_VAR `match_dicenumber` to the number of dice of effects to be matched (default is -1). This field is instead used for maximum hit-dice (HD) by some opcodes.
         - INT_VAR `match_dicesize` to the size of dice of effects to be matched (default is -1). This field is used instead for minimum hit-dice (HD) by some opcodes.
         - INT_VAR `match_savingthrow` to the saving throw type of effects to be matched (default is -1).
         - INT_VAR `match_savebonus` to the saving trow bonus effects to be matched (default is -11). Since saving throws can range into negative values, this variable can match all the way down to -10.
         - INT_VAR `match_special` to the special field of effects to be matched (default is -1). The special field is used by some EE effects.
         - STR_VAR `match_resource` to the resource of effects to be matched (default is "SAME").
         Once a matching effect is found, the next series of variables allows the function to change the fields to these new values in the matched effect. Any variables not set in this batch will keep their existing values.
         - INT_VAR `opcode` to the value the of the altered effect's opcode.
         - INT_VAR `target` to the altered effect's target.
         - INT_VAR `power` to the altered effect's power.
         - INT_VAR `parameter1` to the altered effect's parameter1.
         - INT_VAR `parameter2` to the altered effect's parameter2.
         - INT_VAR `timing` to the altered effect's timing mode.
         - INT_VAR `resist_dispel` to the altered effect's resist/dispel setting.
         - INT_VAR `duration` to the altered effect's duration.
         - INT_VAR `probability1` to the altered effect's probability1 (the upper bound).
         - INT_VAR `probability2` to the altered effect's probability2 (the lower bound).
         - INT_VAR `dicenumber` to the altered effect's number of dice. This field is instead used for maximum hit-dice (HD) by some opcodes.
         - INT_VAR `dicesize` to the altered effect's size of dice. This field is also instead used for minimum hit-dice (HD) by some opcodes.
         - INT_VAR `savingthrow` to the altered effect's saving-throw type.
         - INT_VAR `savebonus` to the altered effect's saving-throw bonus/penalty. This variable can take negative values down to -10 while still writing to the corresponding field.
         - INT_VAR `special` to the new effect's special field. The special field is used by many EE effects.
         - STR_VAR `resource` to the altered effect's resource reference.

        Patch global (equipping) effects and/or effects on extended headers. This is a PATCH function. All integer variables except `check_globals`, `check_headers`, `header` and `savebonus` default to -1 and negative values result in no change to the corresponding field. The integer variables `check_globals`, `check_headers` and `header` default to 0. The integer variable `savebonus` defaults to -11 and values lower than -10 result in no change to the corresponding field. The string variable `resource` defaults to the string "same", which results in no change to the corresponding field.
         Note that both `check_globals` and `check_headers` are 0 by default, so you need to change one or both of these to 1 to perform any patching at all. If you patch headers, you can further target by using `type` to target melee, ranged, or magical headers. `match_opcode` can be left at -1 to match all effects on your targeted range or targeted to a specific opcode. If the opcode itself needs to be changed, you can use `match_opcode` to target the existing effect and `new_opcode` as the new opcode to use. `duration_high` is an alternative to `duration`, mainly for changing the overall duration of an item's effects. The idea is to allow you to mass patch effects to new durations while leaving the one-time only cosmetics and visuals--which are usual instant or only run for a few seconds--unchanged.
         - INT_VAR `check_globals` to whether to check global (on-equip) effects (0 for no, 1 for yes). (default 0)
         - INT_VAR `check_headers` to whether to check effects on extended headers (0 for no, 1 for yes). (default 0)

    - name: CLONE_EFFECT
      doc: |
        This is a patch function for creature, item, or spell files that will match an existing effect and create a new one based on the matched effect. Numerous variables are available for matching the specified effect and for specifying new values in the new effect based on the matched effect.
        The first batch of variables are meta-variables which will help determine the scope of the function:
        - INT_VAR `check_globals` to whether the function should loop through global effects on items (also known as equipping effects) and spells (default is 1). Creature effects are all global effects, so this variable will always be considered to be one when this function is run on a creature.
        - INT_VAR `check_headers` to whether the function should loop through effects on extended headers on items and spells if set to 1 (default is 1). Creatures have no extended headers, so this variable is ignored when used on creatures.
        - INT_VAR `header` to whether the function should target effects on one specific header, counting the first header as zero. A negative value will match all headers (default is -1). Creatures have no extended headers, so this variable is ignored when used on creatures.
        - INT_VAR `header_type` to whether the function should only clone effects on extended headers of the specified type (1 - melee, 2 - ranged, etc.). Negative values will look at effects on all headers (default is -1). Creatures have no extended headers, so this variable is ignored when used on creatures.
        - INT_VAR `multi_match` to the number of effects to clone in the active stack. If you just want to match the first effect and have the function stop, use 1. Otherwise the function will continue matching until the number of cloned effects matches this value. The function will always make at least one change (e.g. 0 or negative values are treated as 1). (default is 999).
        - INT_VAR `verbose` to whether the function should provide some rudimentary information on how many effects were added (default is 0).
        - INT_VAR `silent` to whether the function should suppress warnings when no effects were added. This option also suppresses the verbose option (default is 0).
        - STR_VAR `insert` to the relative position the cloned effect should be inserted at. A value of `below` puts the new, cloned effect immediately below the matched effect. Values of `first` or `last` will put the new effect at the top or bottom of the effect stack, respectively. All other values will default to `above`, where the effect is added immediately before the matched effect (default is `above`).

        The next batch of variables sets the function boundaries on matching an effect to clone. Any variables not specified will not be used to determine a match. The function will only determine an effect is a match only if ALL of the variables specified are matched.
        - INT_VAR `match_opcode` to the opcode of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_target` to the target of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_power` to the power of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_parameter1` to parameter1 of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_parameter2` to parameter2 of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_timing` to the timing of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_resist_dispel` to the resist/dispel setting of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_duration` to the duration of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_probability1` to probability1 (the upper bound) of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_probability2` to probability2 (the lower bound) of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_dicenumber` to the number of dice of effects to be matched (default -1). This field is instead used for maximum hit-dice (HD) by some opcodes.
        - INT_VAR `match_dicesize` to the size of dice of effects to be matched (default -1). This field is used instead for minimum hit-dice (HD) by some opcodes.
        - INT_VAR `match_savingthrow` to the saving throw type of effects to be matched (default -1).
        - INT_VAR `match_savebonus` to the saving throw bonus of effects to be matched (default -11). Since saving throws can range into negative values, this variable can match all the way down to -10.
        - INT_VAR `match_special` to the special field of effects to be matched (default -1). The special field is used by some EE effects.
        - STR_VAR `match_resource` to the resource of effects to be matched (default \"SAME\").
        Once a matching effect is found, a new effect is created (STR_VAR `insert` determines its placement) with all of the same specifications as the matched effect. The next series of variables allows the function to change the fields to new values in the newly-created effect. Any variables not set in this batch will simply inherit their values from the matched effect.
        - INT_VAR `opcode` to the value the of the new effect's opcode.
        - INT_VAR `target` to the new effect's target.
        - INT_VAR `power` to the new effect's power.
        - INT_VAR `parameter1` to the new effect's parameter1.
        - INT_VAR `parameter2` to the new effect's parameter2.
        - INT_VAR `timing` to the new effect's timing mode.
        - INT_VAR `resist_dispel` to the new effect's resist/dispel setting.
        - INT_VAR `duration` to the new effect's duration.
        - INT_VAR `probability1` to the new effect's probability1 (the upper bound).
        - INT_VAR `probability2` to the new effect's probability2 (the lower bound).
        - INT_VAR `dicenumber` to the new effect's number of dice. This field is instead used for maximum hit-dice (HD) by some opcodes.
        - INT_VAR `dicesize` to the new effect's size of dice. This field is also instead for minimum hit-dice (HD) by some opcodes.
        - INT_VAR `savingthrow` to the new effect's saving-throw type.
        - INT_VAR `savebonus` to the new effect's saving-throw bonus/penalty. This variable can take negative values down to -10 while still writing to the corresponding field.
        - INT_VAR `special` to the new effect's special field. The special field is used by many EE effects.
        - STR_VAR `resource` to the new effect's resource reference.

        Creates a file name that is currently unallocated. This is a PATCH and ACTION function. This function will create a filename using __ as a prefix. __ is reserved by The Bigg and writeable by anybody, as long as you dynamically create the file name (either by using this function or other code of your devising). The algorithm creates file names in base 36, going from __0000.ext to __zzzz.ext; this allows for 36 ^ 4 = 1679616 unique file names.
         To allow users to reinstall your mod without breaking the identity of these files, you can use the `base` parameter to ensure that the same thing will be mapped to the same file on reinstalls. For instance, if you're iterating through Mages to give each of them a spellbook, base should contain your modder prefix, an identifier for the purpose of the call, and the file name you're working on, for instance":" ~tb#spellbooks_%SOURCE_RES%~
         - STR_VAR `extension` to the desired extension (required).

    - name: HANDLE_AUDIO
      doc: |
        Install Ogg--Vorbis compressed audio files in a safe and easy manner. This is an ACTION function.

        This function supports Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux and all IE games, including BG:EE. If the game is not BG:EE, the audio will be decompressed and the resulting .wav files will be `MOVE`d to the override. If the game is BG:EE, the .ogg files are copied into the override and renamed into .wav files. Refer to the `HANDLE_AUDIO` and `HANDLE_TILESETS` tutorial for usage examples and a more practical explanation.

        If the audio files need to be decompressed, this function will use oggdec.exe on Windows, which is by default expected to be found in `audio_path`. The most recent version of oggdec can be downloaded [http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/vorbis/vorbis-tools-win32-bin.7z here] (direct link). On OS X, SoX will be used, which is by default also expected to be found in `audio_path`. SoX compiled for OS X can be downloaded [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/files/sox/14.4.1/sox-14.4.1-macosx.zip/download here]. On GNU/Linux, oggdec will be used, but it is expected to be found on the system path and the user should install it him/herself. If you provide installation instructions for GNU/Linux, just include something to the effect of "install oggdec, which is usually part of the package vorbis-tools".

        If the decompression utility cannot be found, the user is warned that the audio files were not installed.

        - INT_VAR `music` if this variable is not 0 and the game is BG:EE, the audio files are given the extension .acm instead of .wav. This variable has no effect if the game is not BG:EE. By default its value is 0.
        - STR_VAR `audio_path` to the path your .ogg files are stored in. By default this variable is `~%MOD_FOLDER%/audio~`.
        - STR_VAR `oggdec_path` to the path oggdec is located in. By default this variable is `~%audio_path%~`.
        - STR_VAR `sox_path` to the path SoX is located in. By default this variable is `~%audio_path%~`.

    - name: HANDLE_CHARSETS
      doc: |
        Runtime-convert `TRA` files into `UTF-8` in a safe and easy manner. This is an ACTION function.

        This function supports Windows, OS X and GNU/Linux. If the game is BG:EE or BG2:EE, `TRA` files are encoded into `UTF-8` so the text can be installed without causing problems. `HANDLE_CHARSETS` needs to be used before any text is installed and is compatible with `AUTO_TRA` and all other methods of loading `TRA` files.

        Conversion is handled by the program `iconv`. The program is available as part of the base system on OS X and GNU/Linux but a Windows version needs to be included in your mod. A Windows version can be downloaded [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libiconv.htm here].

        In order to function, `HANDLE_CHARSETS` needs to know a few things. First, you need to specify where you keep your `TRA` files. You do this with the variable `tra_path`. Second, `HANDLE_CHARSETS` needs to know where the Windows version of `iconv` is located. You do this with the variable `iconv_path`. Third, `HANDLE_CHARSETS` needs to know which character set the `TRA` files are in. Note that they can only be converted into `UTF-8` and cannot already be in `UTF-8`. You provide this information with `charset_table` or tell `HANDLE_CHARSETS` to try to infer this by itself with `infer_charsets`. Lastly, `HANDLE_CHARSETS` needs to know which `TRA` files to convert and whether any of them should be reloaded. You can do this with `noconvert_array`, `convert_array` and `reload_array`.

        Unless `convert_array` is specified, `HANDLE_CHARSETS` will recursively convert all `TRA` files in `tra_path` except those listed in `noconvert_array`. If `convert_array` is specified, only those `TRA` files listed in the array will be converted. `convert_array` may contain references to `TRA` files in subdirectories of `tra_path`.

        - INT_VAR `infer_charsets` to whether `HANDLE_CHARSETS` should try to infer which character set the `TRA` files are encoded in. It uses the contents of the `%language%` variable (''vide infra''). If the contents of the variable can be recognised, `HANDLE_CHARSETS` will use the character set used by the localised version of BG2 for this language. If the contents of the variable cannot be recognised, or if the `TRA` files use a different character set than the expected one, `HANDLE_CHARSETS` will fail. Refer to the compatibility matrix below for additional information. `infer_charsets` overrides `charset_table`. Defaults to 0.
        - STR_VAR `language` to the name of the language directory you wish to convert. The default value of this variable is `\%LANGUAGE\%`, in other words, the directory corresponding to the language the user selected at the start of the installation. You should never need to alter the value of this variable.
        - STR_VAR `default_language` to the name of the directory used by the default language of your mod, if your mod has one. The default language is typically one for which the translation is always complete and up to date and which you use to guard against incomplete translations. `HANDLE_CHARSETS` will convert the `TRA` files of the default language in addition to those of the user-selected language. Should these two languages be the same, the `TRA` files will only be converted once. Additionally, any `TRA` files listed in the `reload_array` (''vide infra'') will be reloaded for the default language before they are reloaded for the user-selected language. The default value of this variable is `~~` (the empty string).
        - STR_VAR `tra_path` to the path where your mod's language directories are located. `%tra_path%/%language%` should be a valid directory containing `TRA` files.
        - STR_VAR `out_path` to the path to which the converted files should be directed. The default value of this variable is `%tra_path%`, that is, the converted files reversibly overwrite the originals and the conversion is transparent to the rest of your mod. Note that if `%tra_path%` and `%out_path%` are the same directory, the conversion will naturally happen only once regardless of how many times `HANDLE_CHARSETS` are invoked, but if the directories are different, the conversion will happen for every invocation (notably, if `HANDLE_CHARSETS` is invoked among the `ALWAYS` actions).
        - STR_VAR `iconv_path` to the path where iconv.exe is located. Defaults to `%tra_path%/iconv`.
        - STR_VAR `charset_table` to the name of an associative array where the keys are the names of your language directories and the corresponding values are the character sets used by the respective language. The keys must be entirely in lowercase. `charset_table` is not used if you also specify `infer_charsets`.
        - STR_VAR `noconvert_array` to the name of an array indexed by monotonically increasing integers starting from 0. The values should be the names of `TRA` files that should not be converted into `UTF-8`. All `TRA` files in the language directory and its subdirectories except the ones listed in `noconvert_array` will be converted. The .tra file extension is optional. This variable should not be provided if you also provide `convert_array`.
        - STR_VAR `convert_array` to the name of an array indexed by monotonically increasing integers starting from 0. The values should be the names of `TRA` files that should be converted into `UTF-8`. Only those `TRA` files in the language directory or its subdirectories which are listed in `convert_array` will be converted. The .tra file extension is optional. If this variable is provided, `noconvert_array` will not be used.
        - STR_VAR `reload_array` to the name of an array indexed by monotonically increasing integers starting from 0. The values should be the names of `TRA` files which should be reloaded after they have been converted. The .tra file extension is optional. You should use this variable for reloading those `TRA` files loaded by `LANGUAGE` which should also be converted.

        This function supports Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux and all IE games that support the `TIS V1` file format. The program tisunpack, part of `TISpack`, is used to decompress the provided .tiz files and the resulting .tis files are placed in the override. Refer to the `HANDLE_AUDIO` and `HANDLE_TILESETS` tutorial for usage examples and a more practical explanation.

        This function expects to find tisunpack for one or more of Windows, OS X or GNU/Linux in a common directory under the subdirectories `win32`, `osx`, and `unix`, respectively. For example, in `mymod/tiz/win32`, `mymod/tiz/osx` and `mymod/tiz/unix`, the common directory is `mymod/tiz` and `mymod/tiz/win32/tisunpack.exe` should be a valid file. For GNU/Linux, this function also supports tisunpack being located on the system path (something the user would take care of). If you choose to leave tisunpack to the user, you should mention this requirement in any installation instructions you provide.

        If tisunpack for the user's platform could not be found, the installation fails.

        - STR_VAR `tiz_path` to the path your .tiz files are stored in. By default this variable is `~%MOD_FOLDER%/tiz~`.
        - STR_VAR `tisunpack_path` to the common directory where the subdirectories `win32`, `osx` and `unix` are located. By default this variable is `~%tiz_path%~`.

        Works like REPLACE_TEXTUALLY, except that it only works on triggers (for both D and BAF files) and applies Boolean Algebra to ensure that the structure of the trigger is not broken (like REPLACE_TEXTUALLY would do if you are substituting one trigger with several and the matching trigger is inside an OR() block and/or negated).Caveats: 
         this command is very slow, so you should use REPLACE_TEXTUALLY if you are substituting a trigger with another, as well as using IF to 	avoid calling this patch on script files that do not contain the trigger 	you are looking for. 
        the resulting file will have messed up whitespace, so remember that if you plan on using REPLACE_TEXTUALLY later (the file will work correctly 	in-game). Applying another (empty) DECOMPILE_AND_PATCH will fix this issue. 
        the searching regexp must match exactly against a single trigger (so REFACTOR_TRIGGER ~A() B()~ ~C()~ or 	REFACTOR_TRIGGER ~A(~ ~C() A(~ will not work). The substituting 	string can contain multiple triggers.

For example: COPY ~nice.baf~ ~mean.baf~ REPLACE_EVALUATE ~Give(\([0-9]+\),\([0-9]+\))~ BEGIN SET result = (MATCH1 + MATCH2) / 2 END ~Take(%result%)~ This COPY TP2 Action would replace Give(10,20) with Take(15). optcase allows you to decide if the matching is case-sensitive or not. Matching is case-sensitive by default.

        The first value is the row, the second is the column and the third is the required column count. The entry on the given column of the given row is set to the fourth value, but only rows with at least as many columns as the required column count are considered. The fourth value, the new entry, is evaluated specially: if it can be evaluated like a value (e.g., "3+4") it will be evaluated and its integer result will be written as an ASCII string. Otherwise if it is a single string (that is not a variable in scope) that string will be written at the new value. See the SET_2DA_ENTRY tutorial for more information.

            PRINT ~I caught another error!~
        END
        ```

        The actions in `ACTION_TRY` are executed. If none of those fails, the `WITH` part is skipped; otherwise, the error message is printed as usual (use `SILENT`), the exception text (from the `ERROR: blah blah` line) is saved to the `%ERROR_MESSAGE%` variable, and a `MATCH` is executed on that.

        After running the correct error handling code, execution continues after the end of the `ACTION_TRY` block. If you still want to block the installation, use `ACTION_RERAISE` (in theory, you could use `FAIL ~%ERROR_MESSAGE%~`, but this changes the exception and its text, which would cause you headaches when nesting multiple `TRY`s).

If fileName does not exist or has size 0, the result is 0. The comparison ignores case. See also FILE_CONTAINS. Example: COPY_EXISTING_REGEXP ~.*\.CRE~ ~override~ READ_BYTE 0x273 class READ_ASCII 0x280 deathvar PATCH_IF (class = 14) AND // class 14 = CLERIC_MAGE (NOT FILE_CONTAINS_EVALUATED(~pdialog.2da~ ~%deathvar%~)) THEN BEGIN ADD_CRE_ITEM ~POTN08~ #10 #10 #10 ~IDENTIFIED~ ~INV15~ END BUT_ONLY_IF_IT_CHANGES The example gives ten healing potions to all cleric-mages who cannot join the party.

        Please note that the items in the list are defined to be mutually exclusive
        (except `tob` will detect both plain ToB and ToB with BGT installed, for legacy purposes),
        so bg2 will detect a SoA-only game, without either ToB or Tutu installed.
        As such, a mod which is usable with any flavor of BG2 and any flavor of Tutu or BG: EE would contain
        `REQUIRE_PREDICATE GAME_IS ~bg2 tob tutu tutu_totsc bgee bg2ee~`.

      doc: |-
        String must be an in-game or in-override `.dlg` file. Returns:
        - Fails the installation if it can't evaluate the text (an `@x` reference out of bounds)
        - `-3` if the text is not currently in the tlk or in the list of strings to add
        - `-2` if the text is spoken (`= SAY ~Foo~`) at least twice in the file `String`
        - `-1` if the text is never spoken in the file String Otherwise it returns the number of the state in which text is spoken in the file `String`. `@x` references are taken from the loaded TRA files (the ones defined in the Language part).

        **Alternative form**: `STATE_WHICH_SAYS value IN String1 FROM String2`
        As above, except that `@x` references are taken from the `String1` tra file. In particular, one `%s` in `String1` is expanded to the list of directories; for example (as of Sola `v102`), `solarom/%s/epilogue.tra` would match
        - `solarom/american/epilogue.tra`
        - `solarom/french/epilogue.tra`

      doc: |-
        This is legacy syntax for STRING_EQUAL: This expression evaluates to 0 if and only if its two string arguments are equal (have the same length and the same contents). Otherwise it will evaluate to a negative or positive integer, depending on whether the first string argument would sort lexicographically before or after the second string argument. variables within the strings (e.g., "%mykit%") are replaced by their values. Note that variables that you want expanded must be put in %'s, otherwise the raw text will be used. You may use STR_CMP as a synonym for STRING_COMPARE. This function works just like C's strcmp. Note also that STRING_EQUAL and STRING_COMPARE are similar, but STRING_EQUAL has more intuitive return values.

      doc: |-
        Evaluates to the directory in which user files are kept. This is the game path on non-EE-type games. On EE-type games, the USER_DIRECTORY variable is constructed from two parts, the user directory and a game-specific directory. If the file engine.lua exists, WeiDU will attempt to read the game-specific directory from it. If the engine.lua does not exist or does not contain the necessary information, WeiDU will use default paths. On Windows, the user directory is the user's personal directory, as read from the Windows registry. On macOS, the user directory is "$HOME/Documents". On Linux, the user directory is "$HOME/.local/share". In both cases, $HOME is the user's home directory, as read from the pwd database. The default game-specific path for BG: EE is "Baldur's Gate - Enhanced Edition"; for BGII: EE it is "Baldur's Gate II - Enhanced Edition"; for IWD: EE it is "Icewind Dale - Enhanced Edition"; and for PST: EE it is "Planescape Torment - Enhanced Edition".
